  <h2 class='c007'>PREFACE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Although the archaeologists and mythologists constitute
for the most part the number of those seriously
concerned with Greek vases, there still remain many
engaged in the study of Greek literature for whom the
vases are bound to possess an abiding value, since they
often relate the stories that Homer, Pindar, Aischylos,
and Euripides tell. One may find on vases of the fourth,
fifth, and sixth centuries <span class='fss'>B.C.</span> illustrations for not a few
of the famous pieces in Greek poetry. The paintings
may have been an outgrowth of the common stock of
legendary tales, having their origin in the folk-lore, and
in such cases they are independent of the written literature
and go along, so to speak, parallel with the work of
the poets, who drew from the same source. These
paintings are valuable as illustrations of the myths, quite
apart from any literary version of the same. Another
class still more interesting, perhaps, owe their origin to
some particular poem or play, and are to be taken
as direct products of the poets’ work. Such are of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_x'>x</span>prime importance for one who would understand the
poet thoroughly.</p>

<p class='c009'>The first class of paintings of the latter sort are based
on Homer and the Cyclic poets. After the epic literature,
the tragic drama became the chief formative force in
Greek legend and its representation in art. Yet here
again, as in the case of the Cyclic poets, one is compelled
to interpret paintings inspired by works that have come
down to us either as mere names or in a few wretched
fragments. The relation of these monuments to the lost
literature is of paramount importance, but the investigation
is beset with many obstacles and will continue to
be largely a field for the specialist. <em>Extant</em> tragedy and
vase paintings, however, come together at so many
points, and the former is so illumined by the latter, that
every student of the classics should become acquainted
with at least this part of Greek ceramics.</p>

<p class='c009'>The present work represents an attempt to bring this
material together in a convenient and accessible form.
The first chapter, which deals with the influence of
tragedy on other classes of monuments, is meant to be
suggestive, not exhaustive; if I shall have succeeded
here in setting the student to think along some new
lines that in the end will place him in more direct
touch with antiquity, and help him to a better understanding
of Greek tragic poetry and the part it played
in the artistic life of the Greeks and Romans, my aim
will have been achieved. The foot-notes all the way
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xi'>xi</span>through are intended to contain somewhat full references
to the literature of the different topics, and to be a sort of
guide to one who desires to prosecute this study further.</p>

<p class='c009'>In dealing with even the subject of vase paintings and
extant tragedy, it was not possible to omit saying a word
regarding the general question of the earliest influence
of the drama upon the vase painters; this has been
done, however, very briefly, and is no more than a sketch.
Some may think that the subject is disposed of too
quickly; many pages, indeed, might have been written
to advantage on this much mooted point, but this would
have required going far aside from the task which I set
myself; and, further, it did not seem wise to encumber
the work with a discussion necessarily of a nature to
appeal to the archaeologist rather than to the student
of Aischylos and Euripides. It is the latter’s needs that
have been uppermost in my mind, and it will be found
that I have written for him first and for the archaeologist
second.</p>

<p class='c009'>My aim has been to collect and publish all paintings
that can with a high degree of probability be said to
be inspired by any of the extant tragedies, and to unfold
the relation of the two to each other in such a way as to
throw the greatest possible light upon the interpretation
of the literature. Many of the publications where one
can find these paintings are so expensive and inaccessible
that but a comparatively small number of classical
students can make any use of the original works; the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xii'>xii</span>result is that this important class of monuments has
been very little used by philologists. Wherever it seemed
necessary, synopses of the plays have been given, and
these will place the student in possession of everything
required for a full appreciation of the reproductions.
Reference has been made to other monuments representing
scenes based on the plays, so that there is in fact
a sort of archaeological commentary for those who care
to go further and examine the general influence of the
poet over the artist. It should be borne in mind, however,
that I have not been concerned with the myths
involved except in so far as they were <em>the</em> forms invented
or followed by the tragedians. To be sure, opinions
will not be unanimous regarding the interpretation of
some of the paintings, but wherever I have not felt sure
of the debt of the artist to a given play I have preferred
not to publish the work; some such are mentioned in
a separate chapter, where reference is also made to the
literature. My endeavour has been to keep as far as
possible aloof from conjectures and reckless theories
into which one is apt to be drawn in dealing with
questions in archaeology; sins of omission should be
less reprehended in a work of this character than sins of
commission, and although I shall no doubt be judged
guilty of both, I hope to have erred rather on the side
of the former.</p>

<p class='c009'>It will be of special interest to archaeologists to have
the painting on the Medeia amphora, in Munich, correctly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xiii'>xiii</span>published; fig. 23 gives for the first time the
correct reading of the inscriptions, and for this reason
I could have wished that space had permitted a much
larger reproduction. The frontispiece, presenting a
general view of the whole vase, will, it is hoped, be
of some help in affording those who have not had an
opportunity of seeing the originals, some notion of the
size and magnificent workmanship of this class of vases,
called so appropriately by the Germans <i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Prachtamphoren</span></i>.
Another painting, fig. 3, is published for the first time,
and fig. 6, taken from a photograph, displaces the
drawing in Jahn’s <cite>Vasenbilder</cite>. Further than this,
the illustrations are the same as those that have already
appeared elsewhere; it has been possible for me to add
new information regarding the whereabouts of some few
vases.</p>

<p class='c009'>On the spelling of Greek names it need only be said
that I have nearly always preferred the Greek forms to
the Latin equivalents; yet I have not gone so far as
to write <em>Hiketides</em> for <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Supplices</span></i>, or <em>Hepta</em> for <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Septem</span></i>;
neither did it seem advisable to disturb a word so
common in English as is <cite>Oedipus</cite> by writing it <em>Oidipous</em>,
or much less <em>Oidipus</em>.</p>

<p class='c009'>My thanks are due to Professor Otto Kern for help
and encouragement while he was still at the University
of Berlin. Professor Carl Robert has lent me valuable
assistance, and I scarcely know whether I am more
indebted to his suggestive replies to my numerous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xiv'>xiv</span>inquiries or to his writings, which latter have been
a constant inspiration to me. Professor A. Furtwängler,
whose profound knowledge in the field of Greek ceramics,
as well as in every department of classical archaeology, is
well known, has aided me by his counsel and has spared
some of his valuable time to go over all the manuscript.
I wish to express my indebtedness to all these eminent
scholars as well as to Mr. Charles B. Newcomer, M.A.,
who has been kind enough to read the proof, and
has favoured me with many valuable suggestions.
Mrs. Huddilston, who more than any one else has
followed all the work, deserves special mention; there
is scarcely a page that does not bear evidence of her
sound judgement.</p>

<p class='c009'>I indulge the hope that this little book may, with all
its defects (and I am well aware they are many), present
much that is helpful in a field in which there is little
addressed to the student of classical literature; and this
brings me to remark that I have long wondered why the
editions of the Greek tragedies are not enlivened more
with reproductions of works of art pertaining to the
myth involved. There is no reason why the student
who is set to read the <cite>Choephoroi</cite>, <cite>Eumenides</cite>, <cite>Medeia</cite>, or
<cite>Iphigeneia in Tauris</cite>, not to mention other plays, should
look only at the literary and philological sides of the
author. Is it considered unscholarly to illustrate books
of this sort, or are the scholars who edit them ignorant
of the archaeological apparatus? The time is coming,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xv'>xv</span>I firmly believe, when these two departments of classical
studies will not be so divorced as they are at present,
and when the monuments based upon a myth will be
included in our text-books and examined quite as closely
as is the text of the poet. When Greek art is thus made
to supplement the study of the poetry, the latter will be
invested with a still greater charm than it now possesses.
More of the spirit is required and less of the letter, and
this is bound to be brought about when Greek art is
introduced more extensively into the instruction in Greek
studies. I trust that these pages will be considered
a contribution towards this manner of studying Greek
tragedy, and that the plays which come in question will
be read with renewed interest by all students, and
reviewed with pleasure and profit by those who are
instructors in classics; and again by those who in the
various walks of life still have time and inclination to
turn occasionally to the masterpieces of Greek letters—works
that will always remain substantial parts of the
world’s literary ballast.</p>

</div>
<h3 class='c017'>§ 1. <span class='sc'>Introductory.</span></h3>

<p class='c018'>Painting as a fine art has never been developed to
any great degree of perfection independent of literature.
The two are, in a sense, handmaids, each inspiring the
other and assisting it to solve new problems. A great
literature is, furthermore, a necessary precursor of great
achievements in art, since the latter is the more dependent
of the two, and seeks its inspiration from the poet.
This may not be clear to one who looks about at
painting in this age of eclecticism, and endeavours to
satisfy himself that literature and art are thus related,
and that the former is required to give the initial
impetus to the latter. The principle can, however, be
made plain by going back nearer the fountain spring of
modern literary and artistic development. One should
turn to the Italian Renaissance of the fourteenth and
fifteenth centuries—to the period when Dante became
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>the teacher and guide of artistic notions—in order to
observe the full meaning and force of the supremacy
of literature. There, where for the first time in the
modern world a great genius fashioned the thought of
more than a century, one can study easily the power
of the poet over the artist. The influence of Dante
upon artistic notions from Giotto down to the present
has, indeed, been incalculably great. No painter of
the <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">quattrocento</span></i>, at least, worked in any other than the
Dantesque spirit; whether consciously or unconsciously,
he was under the spell of the father of Italian letters.
Dante’s Hell and Paradise became the Hell and
Paradise of Signorelli and Michel Angelo. Botticelli,
Flaxman, Doré, and many others left their canvasses
and frescoes to interpret the hidden secrets of the
<cite><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Divina Commedia</span></cite>. The great Christian Epic which
Cornelius developed through many years of study and
contemplation of Dante, and which he considered the
crowning work of his life, is told in the altar fresco
of the Ludwig’s Church in Munich. Yet this is but one
of the many monumental works of this century which
owes its existence to this poet. Delacroix’s ‘Barque of
Dante,’ exhibited in the Paris <em>Salon</em> of 1822, has been
called the first real painting of the century. When one
turns to England there is Rossetti, with ‘Beatrice and
Dante,’ ‘Dante’s Dream,’ and several other famous
paintings that witness again to the influence of the
Italian poet. But one may remark that Dante’s position
in the history of human progress is unique. This is true.
The world has not known another whose authority was
so absolute or whose philosophy appeared so final.
The influence of poets of less power has been correspondingly
smaller. The principle, however, remains true.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>The poet ventures where the boldest artist has not gone
and prepares, as it were, the way for him.</p>

<p class='c009'>The closest parallel to Dante’s influence upon the
trend of artistic notions must be looked for in ancient
Greece; Homer must be named with Dante. The
Homeric poetry has exercised a power which the
<cite><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Divina Commedia</span></cite> has scarcely surpassed; the thousand
and more streams of influence which rose in the Greek
epic literature went out in every direction to water the
fields of art and letters in Greece and Rome, and flowed
on again after Petrarch’s time, and are to-day mighty
forces. Events and incidents of the <cite>Iliad</cite> and <cite>Odyssey</cite>
have taken so permanent a place in modern art that
one hardly stops to think that this or that is from
Homer. But this company of persons which the world
calls Homer was not the only vital force that shaped
men’s thoughts and furnished the artist with fresh
inspiration. The tragic poets are to be named with
Homer. Had Aischylean, Sophoklean, and Euripidean
elements not entered into ancient and modern works
of art the world would never have known some of its
most beautiful monuments. This is not, however, the
place to linger over the influence of the Greek epic and
tragic literature in modern times, interesting though
this would be. It is in ancient times, when there was
still among the people a peculiar interest in the mythic
legends, that the contact of poet and artist is most
apparent; it is with the three Greek tragedians that
we have to do at present, and some traces of their work
may be pointed out in the various classes of monuments
before the vase paintings are examined.</p>

  <h3 class='c019'>§ 2. <span class='sc'>Tragic Influences in Sculpture.</span></h3>
</div>

<h4 class='c017'>1. <em>Greek Sculpture.</em></h4>

<p class='c018'>One does not expect the sculptor’s notions to be
largely shaped by a definite situation in literature, as
he has little to do with illustration; his art is too
severe and confined to reproduce the dramatic and
pathetic with great success. There is accordingly little
direct influence of the Greek tragic literature over
ancient sculpture except on the sarcophagi. Of the
monuments belonging to the fifth century <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>, which
owe their existence indirectly to the drama, three reliefs
occupy the foremost place. These are the well-known
Orpheus<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c020'><sup>[1]</sup></a>, Peliades<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c020'><sup>[2]</sup></a>, and Peirithoös<a id='r3' /><a href='#f3' class='c020'><sup>[3]</sup></a> reliefs, all of which
belong close to the time of the Parthenon frieze.
Reisch has made it clear that these works were conceived
and carried out in the spirit of the tragic drama<a id='r4' /><a href='#f4' class='c020'><sup>[4]</sup></a>.
They are claimed, indeed, as dedicatory offerings in
memory of particular tragic exhibitions, but no attempt
is made to name any poet or tragedy with which they
were connected. Whether one is correct in holding
these reliefs as <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀναθήματα</span>, certain it is that in every
particular they breathe forth the spirit of tragedy. The
triple group in each has been pointed out as corresponding
to the three actors. This, however, is an outer
sign that might serve to indicate their origin. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>relation of the figures to each other—the conflict of soul
which one may observe—the pathos that pervades the
groups—these are so unlike anything that occurs on
the earlier monuments that a person involuntarily asks
himself whence the artists received their motives.
Tragedy provides the answer. The parting scene
between Alkestis and Admetos which Euripides describes
so beautifully belongs to the same decade as
does the Orpheus relief. This touching episode may
well have been the incentive to some such work as the
parting between Orpheus and Eurydike. In all three
instances the sculptor was at any rate occupied with
the problems which concerned the tragic poet, and he
reproduced true echoes of dramatic situations.</p>

<p class='c009'>Related to these reliefs is another class of monuments
which grew out of the tragic performances. From the
middle of the fifth century <span class='fss'>B.C.</span><a id='r5' /><a href='#f5' class='c020'><sup>[5]</sup></a> till at least the close
of the third century <span class='fss'>B.C.</span><a id='r6' /><a href='#f6' class='c020'><sup>[6]</sup></a> it was customary for the
successful choregos to dedicate the tripod that the state
had given him as a prize. The magnificence and
elaborateness accompanying this ceremony can be
learned from the still extant Lysikrates monument
upon which the tripod once stood and on the intercolumniations
of which tripods in relief are represented.
A street in Athens was given over to the exposition of
these prizes. Pausanias states that they were of bronze
and stood on temples<a id='r7' /><a href='#f7' class='c020'><sup>[7]</sup></a>. More important still for us in
this connexion is the fact that together with the tripod,
probably under the kettle, it was the custom to set up
a figure of a satyr or Dionysos or Nike<a id='r8' /><a href='#f8' class='c020'><sup>[8]</sup></a>. This practice
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>does not appear to have been older than the time of
Praxiteles. So it is that one learns of his famous satyr
which Pausanias mentions in connexion with one of the
tripods<a id='r9' /><a href='#f9' class='c020'><sup>[9]</sup></a>. The Greek of this passage does not admit
of a satisfactory interpretation, and it is not possible
therefore to determine what the attitude of the figure
was. It is probable that the statue which was thus
intimately associated with the Dionysiac performances
was the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">περιβόητος</span> satyr of Praxiteles, existing in so
many copies and known throughout English literature
as the ‘Marble Faun.’ One can easily understand that
this class of choregic monuments was alone of great
importance, and that through this channel the tragic
performances worked a wide influence over sculpture.
There was a vast number of statues in bronze and
marble that thus arose from the exigencies of the
theatre. Along with these works may be classed the
numerous pieces of sculpture that were put up as
decorations for the theatre. Such were the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">εἰκόνες</span>
mentioned by Pausanias as being in the Dionysiac
theatre at Athens. The periegete names the statues
of Aischylos, Sophokles, Euripides, and Menander<a id='r10' /><a href='#f10' class='c020'><sup>[10]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c009'>A large number of reliefs that represent Dionysos
receiving the worship of mortals, or advancing in a train
of satyrs before a man lying on a couch, makes up
another class of sculpture, which probably owed its
origin to the drama. On the Peiraieus<a id='r11' /><a href='#f11' class='c020'><sup>[11]</sup></a> relief three
persons carrying tragic masks advance before the god
who reclines upon a <em>kline</em>. The work may possibly be
dated as early as the close of the fifth century <span class='fss'>B.C.</span><a id='r12' /><a href='#f12' class='c020'><sup>[12]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>It is at any rate an early example of the influence of the
tragic muse upon sculpture. The so-called Ikarios reliefs
illustrating Dionysos’ first appearance in Attica, and
the consequent origin of tragedy, may not refer to
Ikarios at all, but are nevertheless to be linked to tragedy
in some way, as the masks clearly show<a id='r13' /><a href='#f13' class='c020'><sup>[13]</sup></a>. They may
have been purely decorative work, or were perhaps
offerings of actors.</p>

<p class='c009'>It remains to speak of a few monuments which seem
to have been more directly under the influence of particular
tragedies. One hears, for example, that the
sculptor Seilanion made a ‘Dying Iokaste.’<a id='r14' /><a href='#f14' class='c020'><sup>[14]</sup></a> This notion
would appear to have been borrowed from some play.
One may think of the <cite>Oedipus Tyrannus</cite> of Sophokles or the
<cite>Phoinissai</cite> of Euripides. Of far greater importance is the
relief on one of the columns from Ephesos which is known
to every one<a id='r15' /><a href='#f15' class='c020'><sup>[15]</sup></a>. The most satisfactory interpretation of
this work so far offered explains the scene as Alkestis
being delivered from Death. The heroine, rescued from
Thanatos by Hermes, is being conducted to the upper
world again. Unfortunately there is no agreement among
archaeologists on this explanation<a id='r16' /><a href='#f16' class='c020'><sup>[16]</sup></a>. Until a better one
is brought forward, however, this important monument
may be held as evidence for the influence exerted by
Euripides’ handling of this popular myth. The <cite>Alkestis</cite>
is known to have been exceptionally well received.</p>

<p class='c009'>If tragic influences are only possibly at hand in the
fragment from Ephesos, the excavations at Pergamon
have brought to light extensive remains of reliefs that
were inspired by Attic tragedy. The Telephos frieze,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>now in Berlin, is directly associated with the drama.
The mythic founder of Pergamon had a long and varied
career, which was told in dramatic form by both Sophokles
and Euripides. The suggestions for the reliefs in question
came from the <cite>Auge</cite> and <cite>Telephos</cite> of the latter, and the
<cite>Mysoi</cite> of the former<a id='r17' /><a href='#f17' class='c020'><sup>[17]</sup></a>. In these fragments one can see
distinctly the high esteem in which the Attic drama was
held at the court of the Attalidai. I know of no Greek
sculpture which comes so near being an illustration of
tragedy as does this frieze.</p>

<p class='c009'>Another work of monumental greatness belonging to
about the same period and exhibiting unmistakable signs
of tragic influence is the Farnese Bull in the National
Museum in Naples<a id='r18' /><a href='#f18' class='c020'><sup>[18]</sup></a>. This colossal group, which represents
Dirke being tied to a rampant bull by Amphion
and Zethos, the sons of Antiope, is characterized by
a passion and violence that are late products in Greek
sculpture. Such motives made their appearance first in
the fourth century <span class='fss'>B.C.</span> Niobe and her children are the
earliest representation on a grand scale of these elements
that are so akin to the drama. Such compositions were
first possible with Praxiteles and Skopas who broke
away from the traditions of the Pheidian age. The
generation that saw a new type of Dionysos and of
Aphrodite, and could appreciate the frenzied maenad
of Skopas, had been prepared for these new motives very
largely through the theatre. The drama had not a little
to do with impressing the artist and his public with the
importance of delineating the human feelings. In the
case of the Niobe group one would not attempt to
point out any special influence of the <cite>Niobe</cite> of Aischylos
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>or Sophokles, and still there is little doubt in my own
mind that the sculptor was more or less influenced by
the tragic literature. May not Praxiteles or Skopas,
each of whom shares the credit of the Niobe group, have
been led to the pathetic look upon the mother’s face by
the lines of one of these lost plays? This new tendency
in sculpture reached its highest expression in the
Laokoön and the Farnese Bull. The latter can be
traced to the influence of Euripides’ <cite>Antiope</cite>, which
appears to have been the source of all Dirke monuments
in ancient art; there is no dissenting voice as to
Euripides’ right to occupy the honourable position thus
assigned<a id='r19' /><a href='#f19' class='c020'><sup>[19]</sup></a> him. Reference has already been made to the
Laokoön<a id='r20' /><a href='#f20' class='c020'><sup>[20]</sup></a> as representing the culmination of tragedy in
marble. The view held by Lessing and many others
that Virgil was the sculptors’ authority has been
abandoned long since. The Pergamon altar frieze has
enabled us to fix the date of the Laokoön with approximate
correctness. It is surely some centuries older than
the <cite>Aeneid</cite> and stands therefore in a possible relation to
the <cite>Laokoön</cite> of Sophokles. Yet here again opinions
vary widely. Sophokles’ play is lost, and the few remaining
fragments are not enough to enable one to
make a satisfactory reconstruction. The story came
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>down from the epic literature, and, like so many incidents
in the fall of Troy, needed no further popularization
in order to appeal to the artist. That Sophokles’ tragedy,
however, was wholly without any influence on the
Rhodian sculptors who so tragically and realistically
represented Apollo’s vengeance on his priest seems to
me highly improbable. Such a conception as found
expression in this masterpiece of sculpture may well
have sprung from the masterpiece in poetry which was at
hand in Sophokles’ <cite>Laokoön</cite><a id='r21' /><a href='#f21' class='c020'><sup>[21]</sup></a>.</p>

<h4 class='c017'>2. <em>The Etruscan Ash-urns.</em></h4>

<p class='c018'>The reliefs on the Etruscan and Roman sarcophagi
carry us to Italian soil and furnish us with a much larger
field for pursuing our subject than could be found in
Greek sculpture. Of all the Italian races with whom
the Greeks came into contact, the Etrurians were by far
the most advanced in civilization; and during the
centuries of active commercial relations between the two
peoples this nation, whose origin is the puzzle of historians,
and whose language is the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">crux</span></i> of philologists,
came more under the influence of Greek literature and
art than any of the Latin races that remained unhellenized.
They have left abundant evidence of these
hellenizing influences. In various classes of monuments
which may still be studied—urns, mirrors, cistae, tomb-paintings,
and vases—one discovers Greek mythology
and poetry. The national mythology of the Etruscans is
so much of an exception in their art, and the Greek is so
universally adopted, that one is at a loss to account for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>the strange fact. On hundreds of Etruscan monuments
one sees the workings of Greek poetry, which found
its way into Etruria before Livius Andronicus produced
the first tragedy in Rome 240 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span> That the Greek
drama was introduced for the most part directly and not
through the medium of the early Latin tragedians, is
shown by the fact that the latter flourished in the second
and first centuries <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>, while the urns exhibiting tragic
subjects are, for the most part, from the third century <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>
Some may, indeed, date from the fourth century. Roman
tragedy can not be said to have really become at all a
matter of general interest before Ennius went to Rome in
204 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span> He died 169 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>, and one should not think that the
influence of these Latin adaptations and translations of
Greek plays took an immediate hold upon the neighbouring
Etruscans. Such elements percolate gradually into the
various strata of national life, to say nothing of the time
required to reach a foreign people whose language and
customs are so different. But the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">summus epicus poeta</span></i><a id='r22' /><a href='#f22' class='c020'><sup>[22]</sup></a>
was not the most popular or most prolific pilferer of
Greek plays. His tragedies numbered only about twenty.
<cite><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">In Accio circaque eum Romana tragoedia est</span></cite><a id='r23' /><a href='#f23' class='c020'><sup>[23]</sup></a>; and the
probable truth of this statement is well attested by
the list of fifty plays that have come down to us under
Accius’ name. This poet, however, was born 170 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span> and
first exhibited tragedies in 140 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span> It is therefore very
doubtful whether one can rightly speak of the influence
of Latin tragedy upon the Etruscan artists. One dare
not, at any rate, bring the ash-urns too far into the
second century <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>, as Brunn and those immediately
under his teaching formerly did. More recent investigations
have proved the chronological impossibility of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>interpreting these reliefs with the help of Ennius, Accius,
and Pacuvius.</p>

<p class='c009'>Without taking time and space to review the arguments
on which the interpretations of the reliefs are based it
will be enough for my purpose to simply add a list of the
scenes which one may reasonably refer to Greek tragedy.
Examining the first volume of Brunn’s <cite><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">I rilievi delle urne
etrusche</span></cite>, which is devoted to urns with scenes from the
Trojan Cycle, one learns that those presenting a version
of the stories ascribable to the tragic poets exceed those
that are based on the <cite>Iliad</cite>, <cite>Odyssey</cite>, and other epics.
The representation of Paris’ return to his Trojan home
is, with one exception<a id='r24' /><a href='#f24' class='c020'><sup>[24]</sup></a>, the most frequent. The thirty-four
reliefs were referred, even in the time of the former
late dating, to Euripides’ <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ἀλέξανδρος</span><a id='r25' /><a href='#f25' class='c020'><sup>[25]</sup></a>. The fate of Telephos
was, according to Aristotle, a common subject for
a tragedy<a id='r26' /><a href='#f26' class='c020'><sup>[26]</sup></a>. We have already met the story on the
Pergamon frieze, and it is very frequent on the Etruscan
urns. Telephos grasps the young Orestes and threatens
his life on the altar after the manner of the drama. It
may be the influence of Aischylos or Euripides, but if one
judges from the comparative popularity of these poets
in this period he would be inclined to assign the first
place to the latter<a id='r27' /><a href='#f27' class='c020'><sup>[27]</sup></a>. The offering of Iphigeneia occurs
on twenty-six urns, nearly all of which were found in
the vicinity of Perugia<a id='r28' /><a href='#f28' class='c020'><sup>[28]</sup></a>. It was again unquestionably
Greek tragedy that was the incentive for these scenes.
Aischylos, Sophokles, and Euripides may all share the
credit of having furnished the literary source. A smaller
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>series of urns representing Odysseus’ adventure in taking
Philoktetes from Lemnos is also to be placed under the
influence of the fifth century tragedy<a id='r29' /><a href='#f29' class='c020'><sup>[29]</sup></a>. The <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">δόλιος
Ὀδυσσεύς</span> is seen playing his part as cleverly as he does
in the extant play of Sophokles. The attitude of
Philoktetes standing before Neoptolemos, having in two
cases the arrow in his hand, corresponds well to the
character drawn by this poet. The injured chieftain
displays his courage and scoffs at the thought of being
carried away by the detested Odysseus. The murder of
Aigisthos and Klytaimestra represented on seventeen
urns has been shown by Schlie to be essentially
Euripidean<a id='r30' /><a href='#f30' class='c020'><sup>[30]</sup></a>. The arrival of Orestes and Pylades at the
precinct of the Tauric Artemis is possibly the subject of
three reliefs<a id='r31' /><a href='#f31' class='c020'><sup>[31]</sup></a>. This would also take one directly to
Euripides<a id='r32' /><a href='#f32' class='c020'><sup>[32]</sup></a>. The following are published in the second
volume of the <cite><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Urne etrusche</span></cite> by Körte. Medeia escapes
on her dragon-chariot, driving over the bodies of her
children<a id='r33' /><a href='#f33' class='c020'><sup>[33]</sup></a>—an echo of the great tragedy that exercised
so wide an influence in other fields of art<a id='r34' /><a href='#f34' class='c020'><sup>[34]</sup></a>. The
punishment of Dirke on four reliefs is based without
question on the <cite>Antiope</cite> of Euripides<a id='r35' /><a href='#f35' class='c020'><sup>[35]</sup></a>. The blinding
of Oedipus at the hands of Laios’ sons seems to have
been an invention of the same poet and is recognized in
another relief<a id='r36' /><a href='#f36' class='c020'><sup>[36]</sup></a>. The Theban fratricide and the assault
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>on the city were both much-prized subjects<a id='r37' /><a href='#f37' class='c020'><sup>[37]</sup></a>. Körte
points out many features common to the numerous
reliefs and the <cite>Phoinissai</cite> of Euripides<a id='r38' /><a href='#f38' class='c020'><sup>[38]</sup></a>. The death of
Alkmene is represented on five urns which one would
associate with the <cite>Alkmene</cite> of the same poet<a id='r39' /><a href='#f39' class='c020'><sup>[39]</sup></a>. Euripides’
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Κρῆτες</span> is traceable on seven reliefs, showing the
legend of Daidalos and Pasiphaë<a id='r40' /><a href='#f40' class='c020'><sup>[40]</sup></a>. Theseus’ fight with
the Minotaur occurs four times and reminds us of
Euripides’ <cite>Theseus</cite><a id='r41' /><a href='#f41' class='c020'><sup>[41]</sup></a>. The death of Hippolytos on
eight reliefs does not present any essential variation
from the extant Greek tragedy<a id='r42' /><a href='#f42' class='c020'><sup>[42]</sup></a>. Perseus and Andromeda
are met with likewise and emphasize the wide
popularity of Euripides’ play<a id='r43' /><a href='#f43' class='c020'><sup>[43]</sup></a>. The famous legend of
Oinomaos’ death and Pelops’ triumph occurs on thirty-one
urns<a id='r44' /><a href='#f44' class='c020'><sup>[44]</sup></a>. It can be shown that these were inspired by
one or more of the lost tragedies that dealt with the
subject<a id='r45' /><a href='#f45' class='c020'><sup>[45]</sup></a>. The <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Μελέαγρος</span> of Euripides appears to have
been the source of at least three of the many reliefs
representing the Kalydonian Hunt<a id='r46' /><a href='#f46' class='c020'><sup>[46]</sup></a>. To this long list
of urns based on Euripidean tragedies one must still
add seven that were probably inspired by this poet’s
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Μελανίππη ἡ σοψή</span> and three more that follow his
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Μελανίππη ἡ δεσμῶτις</span><a id='r47' /><a href='#f47' class='c020'><sup>[47]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c009'>More than two-thirds of the more than four hundred
Etruscan urns examined are decorated with sculpture
based on Greek tragedy, and in nearly all instances the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>drama was Euripidean. Such are the instructive facts
regarding this important class of monuments.</p>

<h4 class='c017'>3. <em>Roman Sarcophagi.</em></h4>

<p class='c018'>Under the expression ‘Roman sarcophagi’ one understands
those of the first and second centuries <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> unless
the expression is further qualified. Sarcophagi from
the time of the Republic are very rare and they are
withal modest in their workmanship. The florid
decorations of the time of the Empire, and especially of
the period just noted, are often of secondary interest,
but the reliefs on the sarcophagi are for the most part
of prime importance, as furnishing reminiscences of lost
tragedies and ancient paintings of great renown. The
majority are copies of very ordinary merit, while now
and then a sarcophagus relief is not unworthy a Greek
artist of the fourth century <span class='fss'>B.C.</span></p>

<p class='c009'>It is a commonly known fact that long before the
Laokoön, or the Farnese Bull, or the Apollo Belvidere
was unearthed in the sixteenth and fifteenth centuries—long
before the classical antiquities of Rome, Florence,
and Naples had attracted students and lovers of art—the
sculptures of these sarcophagi, scattered about in
cathedrals and palaces, had begun to teach the Italian
artist what the human figure really is, and what
composition and decoration should be. The Renaissance
artist first learned the charm and simplicity of the
ancient costume from these marbles and perceived how
vastly superior this was to the heavy, conventional
church-dress that concealed the outlines of the form and
rendered grace and beauty impossible. The study of
the antique, we have reason to believe, was in the early
Renaissance largely a study of these Roman sarcophagi.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>There is no need of going into detail. It will be
enough to hint at the most important monuments of
this class that stand under the influence of Greek
tragedy. Whether they are a direct product of the
Greek plays or are founded on the Latin translations, or
whether they represent copies of Greek paintings based
on Greek tragedy—this is for the present purpose all
one and the same. It is not necessary to determine
whence the incentive came. The important fact for one
to grasp first is, that a surprisingly large number of the
reliefs owe their existence to the tragic drama, and that
these sculptures should be brought into one’s study of
the tragic poets<a id='r48' /><a href='#f48' class='c020'><sup>[48]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c009'>The series of reliefs illustrating Euripides’ <cite>Alkestis</cite> is
of prime importance for one who wishes to see in art
a scene worthy of the poet<a id='r49' /><a href='#f49' class='c020'><sup>[49]</sup></a>. The touching farewell of
Alkestis as she reclines upon her death-bed is in each
instance the centre of the groups on the long side.
Around her gathers the whole family. The children
draw up close to their mother’s side. Her parents are
also present, and this lends more interest to the sight,
for they could scarcely be absent although the poet does
not mention them in this connexion. The last words of
Alkestis, and Admetos’ reply, form the real charm of
the play. All else falls far behind these speeches, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>following one of the gems in Greek literature the artist
could afford to assign his illustration the first place on
the reliefs. Arranged on either side are the other incidents
of the drama, following the poet with considerable
faithfulness. In this connexion should be mentioned the
relief in Florence, also based upon the same source<a id='r50' /><a href='#f50' class='c020'><sup>[50]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Hippolytos sarcophagi are, so far as I know,
the most numerous of those that are dependent upon
tragedy. If we possess more than a score, either entire
or in fragments, after the destructive elements have been
at work on them since antiquity, there is reason to
believe that many times this number were once in
existence. Copies were made in large numbers, and
many a Roman was laid to rest behind the tragedy
in marble which in the <cite>Hippolytos</cite> of Euripides has
continued with some interruptions to move the
sympathies of the civilized world for more than two
thousand years. The reliefs are in the main faithful
illustrations of Euripides. One or two situations are
foreign to him, and these would suggest the influence of
a Roman poet. It is unnecessary to do more here than
to refer to the following chapter, where the whole
question finds a further discussion<a id='r51' /><a href='#f51' class='c020'><sup>[51]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c009'>‘The Orestes myth appears upon the sarcophagi
exclusively in the form given to it by the Attic drama.
The first part—the slaying of Aigisthos and Klytaimestra—follows
the <cite>Oresteia</cite> of Aischylos. The second
part—the meeting of Iphigeneia and Orestes and the
rape of the Tauric idol—is based upon the <cite>Iphigeneia in
Tauris</cite> of Euripides.’<a id='r52' /><a href='#f52' class='c020'><sup>[52]</sup></a> One exception only is noted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>and this appears to represent the influence of a later
play which handled the subject of the <cite>Oresteia</cite><a id='r53' /><a href='#f53' class='c020'><sup>[53]</sup></a>. The
scenes on the other sarcophagi are indeed illustrations
of Aischylos. In each case the final moment of the
<cite>Choephoroi</cite>, when the Furies rush in upon the murderer,
guilty of a mother’s blood, is chosen for the middle
group. Right and left from this the succeeding events
are arranged. The right end scene invariably represents
Orestes as he is about to escape from the sanctuary of
Apollo at Delphi and go to Athens. He picks his way
with circumspection over the sleeping Furies, and one
is led up to the triumphal verdict of the <cite><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Eumenides</span></cite><a id='r54' /><a href='#f54' class='c020'><sup>[54]</sup></a>.
Robert has shown very clearly the relation of these
sculptures to Aischylos’ words, and it is enough to refer
to his discussion.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Iphigeneia-Orestes sarcophagi breathe from first
to last the spirit of Euripides. A study of them is
scarcely less instructive than a reading of the play.
Step by step the story is unfolded. Orestes and Pylades
are taken captives and stand before the priestess, whose
dreadful office is made more horrible by the remains
of human sacrifices that are fastened up around the
sanctuary; the recognition scene with the letter follows.
Then Iphigeneia appears with the idol in her arms, and
asks Thoas’ permission to go and purify it in the sea.
The two Greeks stand bound, ready to follow her, and last
of all comes the <em>mêlée</em> at the ship. One after another of
the barbarians is laid low by the strong arms of Orestes
and Pylades. Iphigeneia is placed safely aboard with
the image, and one sees the beginning of the homeward
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>journey that closed the history of the house of
Atreus<a id='r55' /><a href='#f55' class='c020'><sup>[55]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Euripidean <cite>Medeia</cite> is discussed at length in
another place, and I have pointed out there the part
that the sarcophagi occupy in art representations of the
tragedy<a id='r56' /><a href='#f56' class='c020'><sup>[56]</sup></a>. The two extremes of touching tenderness
and violent passion, which no one ever combined more
successfully in one character than did Euripides in his
Medeia, come prominently to the foreground in these
reliefs. I know of no monuments of ancient art that
grasp the spirit of a Greek tragedy more effectually than
the Medeia sarcophagi. The strange and secret power
of the sorceress hovers over and pervades the whole.
The dreadful vengeance exacted by the slighted queen
is shown in the most graphic manner. Standing before
the Berlin replica, which is the best preserved and most
beautiful of all the sculptures, one cannot but feel that
he is face to face with a marvellous illustration of the
great tragedy. The marble all but breathes; the dragons
of Medeia’s chariot may be heard to hiss.</p>

<p class='c009'>A small number of other monuments of this class
belongs to the ‘Seven against Thebes,’ and, as in the
case of the Etruscan urns, the <cite>Phoinissai</cite> of Euripides is
the main source of the illustrations. Perhaps Seneca’s
<cite>Phoenissae</cite> also entered into the work. Robert conjectures
that Euripides’ <cite>Oedipus</cite> may have furnished
suggestions for parts of the scenes<a id='r57' /><a href='#f57' class='c020'><sup>[57]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c009'>The <cite>Philoktetes</cite> of Sophokles is illustrated on one
relief very much in the manner of the Etruscan urns
already referred to. The wounded Philoktetes stands at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>the mouth of the cave and speaks to Neoptolemos on
the right. Odysseus keeps safely out of sight on the
left<a id='r58' /><a href='#f58' class='c020'><sup>[58]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c009'>The story of Pasiphaë’s unholy love is told on a
fragment of a sarcophagus in the Louvre<a id='r59' /><a href='#f59' class='c020'><sup>[59]</sup></a>; Daidalos
and his cunning work play the leading part. The
ultimate literary authority was Euripides’ <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Κρῆτες</span>. The
latter may not have been used directly, as the myth
enjoyed after this play a continuous popularity. The
relief on one end represents a fruit offering, and as this
would agree with the vegetarian vow of the chorus,
Robert prefers to recognize a direct connexion with
Euripides<a id='r60' /><a href='#f60' class='c020'><sup>[60]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mention may be made lastly of the Meleager sarcophagi,
which, like the Etruscan urns, have much in
common with Euripides’ <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Μελέαγρος</span><a id='r61' /><a href='#f61' class='c020'><sup>[61]</sup></a>.</p>

<h3 class='c019'>§ 3. <span class='sc'>The Influence of Tragedy on Painting.</span></h3>

<p class='c018'>Our knowledge of Greek painting is entirely literary.
No vestige of this art has survived that one may study
the real monuments. The wall paintings of Pompeii
and Herculaneum are, however, a sort of recompense for
this loss, and with these and the assistance of Pliny
and a few other writers one can get some notion of
certain masterpieces of ancient painting. But the records
are at the most very scant, and the student has, after all,
to allow his imagination to fill in many gaps.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>
  <h4 class='c017'>1. <em>On Greek Painting.</em></h4>
</div>

<p class='c018'>The first probable point of contact between tragedy
and painting is in the time of Polygnotos. The series
of paintings mentioned by Pausanias as being in the
Propylaia <em>may</em> be brought under the name of the great
painter, since it is expressly stated that two of the ten
were from his hand<a id='r62' /><a href='#f62' class='c020'><sup>[62]</sup></a>. Among the subjects were Odysseus
fetching Philoktetes from Lemnos; Orestes slaying
Aigisthos; Polyxena on the point of being sacrificed at
Achilles’ tomb. The question arises, have these works
any connexion with the drama? If Polygnotos was the
author of all the paintings, the period of his activity
excludes both Sophoklean and Euripidean influence in
the Philoktetes scene. The <cite>Philoktetes</cite> of Sophokles is
known to have been produced in 409 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>, and the same
play by Euripides appeared in the trilogy with the
<cite>Medeia</cite> in 431 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span> This leaves Aischylos’ tragedy,
which could have served Polygnotos’ purpose. Orestes
killing Aigisthos seems also a possible product of the
<cite>Oresteia</cite>, but Pylades engaging the sons of Nauplios who
came to the usurper’s assistance renders the Aischylean
source improbable. Polyxena’s sacrifice is described
by Euripides in the <cite>Hekabe</cite><a id='r63' /><a href='#f63' class='c020'><sup>[63]</sup></a>, and was the subject of
Sophokles’ <cite>Polyxene</cite><a id='r64' /><a href='#f64' class='c020'><sup>[64]</sup></a>. Nothing, however, can be made
out of the few fragments belonging to the latter.
The character of this picture, in which <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πάθος</span> excluded
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἦθος</span>, led Robert to assign it to the fourth century and
base it upon Euripides<a id='r65' /><a href='#f65' class='c020'><sup>[65]</sup></a>. All these subjects are from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>the Trojan Cycle, and agree well with what is known of
Polygnotos’ taste in selecting his legends. One has but
to recall the painting in the Lesche of the Knidians at
Delphi—<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τὸ μὲν σύμπαν τὸ ἐν δεξιᾷ τῆς γραφῆς Ἴλιός τέ
ἐστιν ἑαλωκυῖα καὶ ἀπόπλους ὁ Ἑλλήνων</span><a id='r66' /><a href='#f66' class='c020'><sup>[66]</sup></a>—to learn that
the drama was not essential to inspire Polygnotos. On
the other hand, a closer examination of the Philoktetes-Orestes
legend reveals the fact that the crafty Ithacan’s
part in bringing Philoktetes from Lemnos was an invention
of the Attic drama<a id='r67' /><a href='#f67' class='c020'><sup>[67]</sup></a>. The tragedians placed
Odysseus in the room occupied by Diomede in the
Trojan Cycle. It is absolutely necessary therefore to
place this painting under the influence of tragedy,
whether it was by Polygnotos and inspired by Aischylos
or by a later artist and inspired by one or more of the
three tragedies. If the Polygnotos authorship be rejected
(and as it is based on pure conjecture there is nothing to
forbid placing it aside), one is at liberty to point out
a relation between these works and later tragic literature,
as has already been done in the case of the Polyxena
scene.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the latter half of the fifth century <span class='fss'>B.C.</span> painting
appears to have reflected pronounced tendencies of the
drama. The legends of the heroic time when tried in
the crucible of the dramatic poet appealed more strongly
to the imagination of the artist who had been accustomed
to epic severeness and calmness. The conventionality
and regulation types gave way, and the tragic drama
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>remained thereafter the vital force in shaping the
character of paintings occupied with heroic legends.
At this time we learn of a Telephos by Parrhasios, which
one naturally associates with Euripides or Aischylos<a id='r68' /><a href='#f68' class='c020'><sup>[68]</sup></a>.
The Iphigeneia of Timanthes was a work that was
scarcely possible but for the fresh interest awakened in
the story by the three tragedians<a id='r69' /><a href='#f69' class='c020'><sup>[69]</sup></a>. It is highly probable
again that Euripides was the inspiration for the Andromeda
of Nikias<a id='r70' /><a href='#f70' class='c020'><sup>[70]</sup></a> and the Medeia of Timomachus<a id='r71' /><a href='#f71' class='c020'><sup>[71]</sup></a>.
These were both works of great renown. Apollodoros’
painting representing the Herakleidai can with some
certainty be referred to Euripides’ tragedy<a id='r72' /><a href='#f72' class='c020'><sup>[72]</sup></a>. Theorus,
a Samian, painted Orestes slaying Aigisthos and Klytaimestra,
and could hardly have worked independent of
Aischylos<a id='r73' /><a href='#f73' class='c020'><sup>[73]</sup></a>. The fate of Pentheus and Lykurgos was
painted in the younger of the two temples in the
Dionysiac precinct south of the Acropolis<a id='r74' /><a href='#f74' class='c020'><sup>[74]</sup></a>. The date of
this temple has been fixed at approximately 400 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span><a id='r75' /><a href='#f75' class='c020'><sup>[75]</sup></a>
The punishment of Pentheus was particularly popular
with the tragedians, and the dependence of this painting
on the play of Aischylos or Euripides is all but certain.
The former’s <cite>Lykurgeia</cite> was the source of the numerous
vase paintings of Lower Italy representing the madness
of the Thracian king<a id='r76' /><a href='#f76' class='c020'><sup>[76]</sup></a>, and one may infer that this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>painting mentioned by Pausanias was essentially the
Aischylean Lykurgos. In the same place were two
other scenes from the career of Dionysos. Ariadne was
represented as being forsaken by Theseus and rescued
by the god, and in another place Dionysos was conducting
Hephaistos to Olympos. Euripides’ <cite>Theseus</cite>
handled the love episode in the first of the two latter,
and this play was probably not without its effect upon
the popularity of the story which was of frequent
occurrence, particularly in Pompeii<a id='r77' /><a href='#f77' class='c020'><sup>[77]</sup></a>. This poet’s power
in dealing with love exploits and depicting the sad case
of unrequited love and the attending calamities, was a new
force in literature and a never-failing spring from which
the painter could draw. These compositions are one
and all connected with Dionysos, while three of them are
parallel with subjects handled in tragedy. Such scenes
were possible only after the drama had popularized the
subjects and prepared the way, so to speak, for the
reception of the same in art. Even though one does not
go so far as to contend that these paintings were an
outgrowth of tragedy, they must be accepted as signs of
the increasing interest in Dionysos and his worship—and
this was primarily the Greater Dionysia, where the first
editions of Greek tragedies were published. This was
the period of Zeuxis and Parrhasios—the time when
Euripidean <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πάθος</span> was shaping artistic conceptions.</p>

<h4 class='c017'>2. <em>The Wall Paintings of Pompeii and Herculaneum.</em></h4>

<p class='c018'>The Pompeian wall paintings, representing scenes from
tragedy, are largely reminiscences of earlier paintings,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>and many famous works that have already been referred
to are doubtless preserved in more or less exact copies
in these invaluable monuments. Besides the Medeia and
Andromeda, which have been noticed above, there is
a series of paintings based on the Hippolytos-Phaidra
casualty<a id='r78' /><a href='#f78' class='c020'><sup>[78]</sup></a>, and another representing the sacrifice of
Iphigeneia<a id='r79' /><a href='#f79' class='c020'><sup>[79]</sup></a>. The latter exhibit a marked similarity to
the work of Timanthes and the final scene in Euripides’
<cite>Iphigeneia at Aulis</cite>. Several important paintings represent
the meeting of Orestes and Iphigeneia in the
Tauric sanctuary, and there can be no question regarding
the decided dramatic colouring here<a id='r80' /><a href='#f80' class='c020'><sup>[80]</sup></a>. Two pictures are
based on the Telephos legend, and remind one again of
the Pergamon frieze and the relation of this to Euripides
and Sophokles<a id='r81' /><a href='#f81' class='c020'><sup>[81]</sup></a>. Daidalos with his wooden cow before
Pasiphaë was another favourite Euripidean story told at
Pompeii<a id='r82' /><a href='#f82' class='c020'><sup>[82]</sup></a>. The excavations in 1895 brought to light
an unusual number of priceless treasures in the <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">casa dei
Vettii</span></i>. Among the paintings was one showing the
death of Pentheus<a id='r83' /><a href='#f83' class='c020'><sup>[83]</sup></a>. The maenads are hurling stones
at him and thrusting him through with their thyrsoi;
the wildness of the locality and the tone of the whole
work make it highly probable that Euripides’ <cite>Bakchai</cite>
was the artist’s inspiration. Mention may be made
lastly of the punishment of Dirke, told in several
paintings<a id='r84' /><a href='#f84' class='c020'><sup>[84]</sup></a>. After what has been said touching the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>Farnese Bull, it is not necessary to point out again the
part played in the Dirke monuments by Euripides’
<cite>Antiope</cite>.</p>

<p class='c009'>A glance at this brief sketch of ancient paintings on
tragic subjects cannot but impress one with the permanent
and far-reaching influence of the tragic poet
over the painter. The striking fact that stands out
prominently before all others is the firm hold exercised
by Euripides. Note the following subjects—Andromeda,
Dirke, Hippolytos, Iphigeneia at Aulis, Medeia.
Each of these characters has stamped upon it the form
given by this poet. Others after him adapted and
translated his work, but the ultimate authority remains
none the less the Greek tragedian, and neither the
ancient nor the modern world accepts any other than
the Euripidean Andromeda, Hippolytos, or Medeia<a id='r85' /><a href='#f85' class='c020'><sup>[85]</sup></a>.</p>

<h3 class='c019'>§ 4. <span class='sc'>Tragic Elements on the Etruscan Mirrors.</span></h3>

<p class='c018'>The engravers of the mirrors were less inventive than
were the sculptors of the ash-urns, and they moved in
a much narrower sphere. Their work is for the most
part that of the ordinary mechanic whose hand is none
too sure. The compositions taken from tragedy are
common with those already met with on the Etruscan
sarcophagi. There are Orestes and Pylades at the
temple of the Tauric Artemis<a id='r86' /><a href='#f86' class='c020'><sup>[86]</sup></a>; the Kalydonian Hunt,
following the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Μελέαγρος</span><a id='r87' /><a href='#f87' class='c020'><sup>[87]</sup></a>; Daidalos constructing the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>wooden cow<a id='r88' /><a href='#f88' class='c020'><sup>[88]</sup></a>; Polyxena taking her farewell of Hekabe<a id='r89' /><a href='#f89' class='c020'><sup>[89]</sup></a>;
three scenes from the Telephos legend<a id='r90' /><a href='#f90' class='c020'><sup>[90]</sup></a>; the parting
scene between Alkestis and Admetos<a id='r91' /><a href='#f91' class='c020'><sup>[91]</sup></a>; and Prometheus
chained to the Caucasus<a id='r92' /><a href='#f92' class='c020'><sup>[92]</sup></a>. These instances at least may
be adduced to emphasize the fact of the wide-spread
familiarity of the Etruscans with tragedy. There is no
doubt whatever that in these common everyday articles,
as well as on their sarcophagi, the Etruscans had illustrations
of the tragic poetry that may have been brought
to them by troops of ‘Dionysiac artists’<a id='r93' /><a href='#f93' class='c020'><sup>[93]</sup></a>.</p>

<h3 class='c019'>§ 5. <span class='sc'>Greek Tragedy and the ‘Megarian Bowls.’</span></h3>

<p class='c018'>Intermediate between sculpture and vase paintings
appears a remarkably interesting class of vases, or
rather cups, which are decorated with a band of relief.
Certain of these are so intimately connected with the
drama, and with Euripides in particular, that at least
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>a brief reference should be made to them here.
Examples of this ware are to be seen in nearly every
large museum, and I have seen fit to include reproductions
of three in the present work, as well as a small
fragment of a fourth<a id='r94' /><a href='#f94' class='c020'><sup>[94]</sup></a>. The inscriptions and general
style of the vases lead one to date them in the second
or third century <span class='fss'>B.C.</span> They are surely not later than
this, and not much earlier. They owe their origin to
a wide-spread interest in the older Greek poets. The
majority of the reliefs represent scenes from the Trojan
and Theban Cycles, and illustrate some poetical work.
We have to do at this time with those that are related
to tragedy. It is plain from a casual glance at the
nature of the compositions taken from tragic literature
that it was not the words of the poet that suggested
the figures to the artist so much as the theatrical performances
themselves. The posings, gestures, groupings—in
short, the general attempt at effect, take one
past the written work to the Hellenistic stage. The
motives are borrowed from Euripides, as played in the
second- and third-century theatre. The humble artist
who conceived these designs had visited the exhibitions
of the <cite>Iphigeneia at Aulis</cite> or of the <cite>Phoinissai</cite>, and
received fresh ideas for his work. It is necessary to
emphasize the fact that these little monuments date
from the time when the dominating force in art was
the tragic drama. The influence of the theatre was felt
among all classes of people. The guilds of Dionysiac
actors travelled around from one village to another, and
from one city to another, producing their <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">répertoire</span></i> from
the three great tragedians, and, even when there was no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>permanent stage, delivered from an improvised platform
bad and indifferent versions of the well-known plays<a id='r95' /><a href='#f95' class='c020'><sup>[95]</sup></a>.
The result was that tragedy was the one popular form
of literature in the Hellenistic period, and this meant
practically that the people were feasted on Euripides.
The ‘Megarian Bowls’ are priceless treasures from this
period when the drama had permeated all classes of
society. The unpretentious reliefs are replete with the
spirit that one may discover at the same time in Italy,
Asia Minor, Athens, and Alexandria. They are direct
witnesses of the fact that Euripides was the people’s
poet, and re-enforce the impression gained from the
study of all other classes of monuments.</p>

<p class='c009'>For my own part I prefer to think of these cups as
answering the place of text illustrations and corresponding
to our illustrated editions of poetical works. One
cannot imagine the papyri texts of the ancient poets
illumined with illustrations, but these ‘Megarian Bowls’
meet every requirement of this kind of art. In order
to keep the reader from going astray in the interpretation
the scenes are often accompanied by inscriptions
that render any misunderstanding impossible. The
several groups showing the successive stages of the play
serve in fact every end that is demanded of illustrations.
Whether the vases were used by schoolmasters in
drilling their boys in classical poetry, or whether they
were ornaments for the home, the poet was sure to
appeal to his admirers in a new manner. He could be
easily remembered by this means if artificial aid was
at all necessary. They had, moreover, the great merit
of being cheap; any number of copies could be made
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>from the mould, and such cups are really in existence<a id='r96' /><a href='#f96' class='c020'><sup>[96]</sup></a>.
If three replicas of one and the same work have
accidentally survived the centuries and can to-day be
studied as text illustrations of Euripides, how extensive
must have been the production and use of this sort
of art in ancient times!<a id='r97' /><a href='#f97' class='c020'><sup>[97]</sup></a></p>

  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER II<br /> <span class='large'>THE INFLUENCE OF GREEK TRAGEDY ON VASE PAINTING.</span></h2>
</div>
<h3 class='c017'>§ 1. <span class='sc'>Theories advanced for the Earliest Point of Contact.</span></h3>

<p class='c018'>The question as to when the tragic drama first began
to influence the vase painters has been in late years
a much mooted one. When our knowledge of vase
chronology was far more fragmentary than it is now,
and the black figured fabric was dated as largely a fifth-century
<span class='fss'>B.C.</span> product, the attempt was made to point
out the dependence on the drama of certain paintings
of this style<a id='r98' /><a href='#f98' class='c020'><sup>[98]</sup></a>. Later, when the improbability of this
theory became more and more plain, and an earlier
date was fixed for the black figured vases, other scholars
endeavoured to show that the painters of Euphronios’
set—the masters of the severe red figured kylikes—stood
under the influence of the three tragedians<a id='r99' /><a href='#f99' class='c020'><sup>[99]</sup></a>. No
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>one would venture, however, to speak now of the
influence of any of the dramatists upon the vase
painters of this style that flourished at the end of the
sixth and beginning of the fifth century. More nearly
correct was the principle laid down by Robert, in his
famous book <cite><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Bild und Lied</span></cite>, that no vase painting of the
fifth century <span class='fss'>B.C.</span> shows the influence of heroic legends
as recast by the tragedians and produced in the theatre.
Before the year 400 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span> one should not expect to find
scenes upon the vases that are the direct outcome of
the tragic drama. This, however, is going too far to
the other extreme. There is a mean that may be
struck, and this is, as will appear, more in accord with
the present knowledge of Greek ceramics.</p>

<h3 class='c019'>§ 2. <span class='sc'>Earliest Evidence.</span></h3>

<p class='c018'>There is one point on which there seems to be little
difference of opinion, and that is, that the lusty choruses
of satyrs that abound on the early red figured vases
were largely popularized through the Dionysiac trains.
These groups of dancing, springing satyrs along with
Dionysos are direct reflexions of the scenes that actually
took place, and as these celebrations were the simple
beginnings of the tragic drama there is in this class of
pictures a remote echo of the theatre. Yet one must
not understand that the artists were conscious of following
any particular performance<a id='r100' /><a href='#f100' class='c020'><sup>[100]</sup></a>. These scenes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>border more on what we should imagine a satyric drama
to have been. It was a long way from this comical,
kick-about dance of the satyrs around Dionysos and
his altar to the time when the actual performance of the
theatre, such as is seen on the Andromeda krater,
occurs on the vases. Still these were beginnings.
Another exceedingly instructive bit of evidence for the
development of tragic influences (or rather it is better
to speak still of Dionysiac influences) is found on a
black figured vase in Bologna<a id='r101' /><a href='#f101' class='c020'><sup>[101]</sup></a>. The painting represents
the epiphany of the god who rides in a ship borne on
wheels and drawn by two satyrs before whom march
two others leading a steer. The god who sits enthroned
upon the ship is being entertained by flute music furnished
by two satyrs riding with him. Such sights we
have reason to believe were not uncommon in Attica,
and it may have been in such a <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">carrus navalis</span></i> that
Thespis travelled the country and established the beginnings
of the later drama. These <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πομπαί</span> and the
satyr-trains appear therefore to be a very significant
inheritance which the earlier vase painters have left us
for the disentangling of the all too bare literary records
touching the origin of the tragic drama.</p>

<h3 class='c019'>§ 3. <span class='sc'>Fifth Century.</span></h3>

<p class='c018'>Long before one can distinguish definite plays reflected
in the vase paintings, certain marks of interest
in tragedy may be detected. There are, for example,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>representations of the ceremony connected with the
dedication of the tripod-prize. The painters of <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">cir.</span></i>
460 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span> have already taken up this part of the dramatic
performances and have indicated thereby the growing
interest in the theatrical exhibitions<a id='r102' /><a href='#f102' class='c020'><sup>[102]</sup></a>. About the same
time also the personification of tragedy and comedy
makes its appearance on the vases<a id='r103' /><a href='#f103' class='c020'><sup>[103]</sup></a>. These are not in
themselves points of so great weight, but they help to
clear the way for understanding the tremendous influence
which the drama had upon artists of the succeeding
generations.</p>

<p class='c009'>Down to the middle of the fifth century the predominating
force in the legendary scenes on the vases was
Homer and the other epic writers. At this point the
latter began to share their popularity with the tragedians,
and gradually but surely passed into the second place.
That Robert’s position is not a correct one seems to me
highly probable, and nevertheless one finds his words so
often quoted that there is need of placing the evidence
together and inquiring anew into the question. For my
own part I am unable to understand why the theatre
did not exert an influence upon the smaller art of vase
industry as well as it did upon the more important
art of painting. When one notes in the fifth century
that great artists like Timanthes and Parrhasios were
drawn under the spell of tragedy it is but natural to
suppose that the same was true also in the case of the
less famous vase painters. Why should the influence
have been more pronounced in one instance than in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>other? If Aischylos and Euripides were popular enough
to warrant the support of the illustrious artists, one may
correctly assume that the vase painter grasped this point
likewise. The latter was primarily concerned in producing
something saleable, and the pictures that were
popular and saleable for the first class were no less so for
the second class. This so far has, however, no further
weight than one’s personal opinion. Let us turn to
the monuments and see what there is to bear out this
view.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Berlin Andromeda krater may be referred to
first<a id='r104' /><a href='#f104' class='c020'><sup>[104]</sup></a>. This is one of the most brilliant examples
ascribable to tragedy. The profusely decorated costumes
induce one to believe that the artist really reproduced
the dress of the actors in Euripides’ play. The
theatrical air about the work is quite unmistakable,
and its Attic origin leads one to connect it directly with
the immense success won by the <cite>Andromeda</cite> in 412 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>
The Kyklops vase, published and discussed below,
also dates from the last quarter of the fifth century<a id='r105' /><a href='#f105' class='c020'><sup>[105]</sup></a>.
A vase in Naples representing Diomedes’ rape of the
Palladium has been referred to Sophokles’ <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Λάκαιναι</span>,
and its date is <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">cir.</span></i> 420 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span><a id='r106' /><a href='#f106' class='c020'><sup>[106]</sup></a> The painting on the
Lower Italy vase published below is also from about
this same time and follows the <cite><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Eumenides</span></cite><a id='r107' /><a href='#f107' class='c020'><sup>[107]</sup></a>. I refer
lastly to the celebrated satyr-play vase in Naples as
belonging to this period, and furnishing at the same time
the most palpable evidence of theatrical influence upon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>the artist<a id='r108' /><a href='#f108' class='c020'><sup>[108]</sup></a>. The picture shows a recital of a satyr
chorus in the presence of Dionysos and Ariadne, and is,
as it were, a snap-shot of this peculiar institution. The
painting has long been the keystone of the ancient
testimony concerning the nature of the satyric drama.
The richness of the costume worn by Dionysos and
Ariadne gives an invaluable illustration of the actors’
dress. In this regard the work is in direct accord with
Pollux’s <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">καὶ ἐσθῆτες μὲν τραγικαὶ ποικίλον&nbsp;... ὁ δὲ
κροκωτὸς ἱμάτιον· Διόνυσος δὲ αὐτῷ ἐχρῆτο, καὶ μασχαλιστῆρι
ἀνθινῷ καὶ θύρσῳ</span><a id='r109' /><a href='#f109' class='c020'><sup>[109]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c009'>These are the most important examples that can be
brought forward to show the influence of the drama on
fifth-century vase painting, and although not to be
compared with the vast number of paintings of a later
period that indicate the development of tragic tendencies,
they seem nevertheless to constitute a considerable
array of evidence for the occurrence of definite tragic
scenes borrowed from the drama. The vase paintings
therefore of the last quarter of this century do furnish
undoubted traces of the forms of the myths seen in the
theatre<a id='r110' /><a href='#f110' class='c020'><sup>[110]</sup></a>.</p>

  <h3 class='c019'>§ 4. <span class='sc'>The Fourth Century and the Conditions in Lower Italy.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c018'>Till the close of the fifth century, or at least till the
time of the Peloponnesian War, the export of vases
from Athens, Corinth, and other centres in Greece was
a lively and paying industry. This traffic had been
carried on with all the Mediterranean and Black Sea
ports, but especially with the cities of Italy. By far the
largest number of sixth- and fifth-century Attic vases
now in the European museums and private collections
have come from excavations in Etruria. This article of
trade must have been highly prized by the Etruscans,
and it is to their fondness for Greek vases that we owe
a very large part of our knowledge in this important
field of classical archaeology. With the founding of
Greek colonies in Italy the Greek industries were likewise
established, and it was but a question of time till
Thurii (founded 445 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>), Tarentum, Herakleia, and
other cities supplied the western demand for vases, and
so destroyed the Attic trade. As a matter of fact, few
Attic vases belonging to the fourth century have been
discovered in Lower Italy, and this means that from
about 400 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span> the demand had fallen off, and the
manufacture in Athens had become gradually less and
less important.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was to favourable soil that this industry was transplanted.
The cities of Magna Graecia and Sicily were
as Greek as were Athens and Corinth, and they were,
besides, far more prosperous. The fourth century was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>one of great luxury in these western capitals and Athenian
art and letters found a hearty welcome here. It is
instructive to observe the clear traces of Athenian art
that are at hand on the coins of these regions. The
legends on the coins of Thurii, Herakleia, Terina, and
Syracuse, dating from the latter half of the fifth century
b.c., are as distinctly Pheidian in style as are those of
the corresponding time at Athens<a id='r111' /><a href='#f111' class='c020'><sup>[111]</sup></a>, and this shows
clearly the intimate intercourse that existed between the
East and the West, and how rapidly the colonists took up
and appropriated the artistic notions of Athens. Many
other things point to the thoroughly Greek landscape
of Southern Italy. Greek names of cities abounded
everywhere, and the ancestral hero of most of the
Apulian towns was Diomede—the Aeneas of the South<a id='r112' /><a href='#f112' class='c020'><sup>[112]</sup></a>.
Each town had its own mint and struck its own coin
with, of course, a Greek legend and a Greek inscription.
Tarentum soon became the largest and most influential
city of Magna Graecia. The city founded by Taras was
destined to be the Athens of the West for some time to
come. Here was the centre from which Attic influences
penetrated inland. The literature and art of Hellas
were received here and handed on to the neighbouring
cities. It is but natural that this flourishing capital
should have become the seat of the vase industry for
this part of Italy. The manufacture was not, however,
confined to the limits of the city. We know that other
towns in Apulia contributed to the vast number of vases
that we know as ‘Tarentine’ fabric. There is every
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>reason to believe that this thoroughly Greek industry
continued without any interruption till the capture of
Tarentum, 272 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>; but at this point the interest in vase
manufacture no doubt began to abate somewhat. When
the commercial independence and rank of Tarentum
were gone the period of decline began, and the vases
that belong to the third century <span class='fss'>B.C.</span> are neither
numerous nor of great worth artistically. The mysteries
of Lower Italy vase chronology are, however, too great
to be settled for some time to come, and it is best not
to be rash in assigning hard and fast dates to a class of
monuments, the investigation concerning which is quite
in its infancy.</p>

<p class='c009'>But what can be said about the drama at Tarentum?
The remarks already made hardly render it necessary
to emphasize the high esteem in which the Attic tragedy
was held. That it was patronized extensively and that
it was <em>the</em> literature of the time was true in any Greek
city of the fourth century, and here where a new Athens
flourished it must have been doubly true. It is interesting,
however, to learn something definite in this regard
concerning the Tarentines. We learn from Plato that
the people were inveterate theatre-goers, and that they
did not stop short of drunkenness at the Dionysiac
feast<a id='r113' /><a href='#f113' class='c020'><sup>[113]</sup></a>. In another place one is told that when the
Roman general Valerius sailed into the harbour in 282 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>
the Tarentines were celebrating the Dionysia and paid
no heed to the practical Roman<a id='r114' /><a href='#f114' class='c020'><sup>[114]</sup></a>. Worse than this,
Pyrrhus found it necessary to order the theatres to be
closed that he might succeed in getting the men out for
military service<a id='r115' /><a href='#f115' class='c020'><sup>[115]</sup></a>. Such was the favourable soil in which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>the Attic drama took root in Lower Italy, and in this
centre the influence of tragedy on the vase decorators
was perhaps more far-reaching than in any ancient city.</p>

<p class='c009'>The extent of the influence may be seen by an
examination of the paintings on the Lower Italy
vases. It has long since been noticed that many of
the Apulian, Campanian, and Lucanian vase paintings
have a marked theatrical composition. The costumes,
posings, and gestures are often notoriously stage-like.
In many cases one can observe the reminiscence of the
stage setting; the scene often represents a temple or
palace in or before which the action occurs<a id='r116' /><a href='#f116' class='c020'><sup>[116]</sup></a>, and even
where one is not able to determine upon the literary
source of the picture the dramatic handling is plain,
and one is convinced that some tragedy furnished the
suggestion for the work. The paintings are not to be
considered by any means reliable copies of any
particular scene in a theatre. They were abridged,
extended or modified at the notion of the artist. When
he took his ideas from the tragedian, he might turn the
characters round to please his own fancy, putting in or
omitting others. He never illustrated. The value of
these paintings in helping one to reconstruct the lost
plays is very considerable. They are generally certain
to provide more valuable information regarding the lost
literature than the few fragments that may have come
down to us<a id='r117' /><a href='#f117' class='c020'><sup>[117]</sup></a>. As the three tragedians of the fifth
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>century <span class='fss'>B.C.</span> were practically the only ones that were
read and heard with pleasure in the fourth century,
their work is the source of nearly all of the paintings
based on tragedy. We may pass on therefore to our
study of Aischylos, Sophokles, and Euripides in their
influence upon the vase painters.</p>

</div>

<h3 class='c017'>§ 1. <span class='sc'>Introduction.</span></h3>

<p class='c018'>Notwithstanding the fact that the oldest of the
tragedians was the least read in the fourth century <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>,
he easily rivals Sophokles in his influence on art.
This was not due to his being more admired, and can
only be accounted for by the bold situations that he
invented-situations new and striking. There are certain
of his plays that left a lasting impression on Greek and
Roman art. Such are the <cite>Choephoroi</cite>, the <cite><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Eumenides</span></cite>,
and the <cite>Lykurgeia</cite>. Further than these, Aischylean
plays did not appeal to the artist to any great extent.
It is the peculiarly popular inventions distinguishable
in these tragedies, their uniqueness, so to speak, that
set them apart by themselves, a mark for the artist.
The character of the plays is easily denoted. They
ring with cries of murder and resound with the storming
fury of avenging deities; we are struck by the perils
of the situations and remain all but breathless to learn
the issue. These features attracted the painter and
sculptor, and this is what meets one on all the monuments
that may be called Aischylean. The deep
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>religious vein that pulsates in every line of the mighty
tragedian is reflected to some degree on the vases and
the sarcophagi. This force in art was rather epic; it
was, in a way, Polygnotean, and the ethical nature of
it all but condemned it for the artists who sought the
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πάθος</span> of Euripides. This very fact explains why
Aischylos and Sophokles did not address themselves
more to the succeeding generations of artists. The
ethical was more difficult to express than was the
pathetic, and it was not so attractive. The spirit of
the times, moreover, demanded the latter as it demanded
Euripides, and consequently one should not
expect to meet a large number of vase paintings that
were made under the influence of either Aischylos or
Sophokles. Those that can be associated with the
extant tragedies of the former are given in the following
pages. It will be observed that certain scenes from
Aischylos were greatly in favour in Lower Italy. All
of the nine paintings published are from Italian ware.
Not one Attic vase that shows an Aischylean scene
has, so far as I know, been discovered. In the West,
however, where he was quite as much at home as in
his own Athens and where he was destined to end his
days, the vase decorators were largely influenced by
him.</p>

<h3 class='c019'>§ 2. <span class='sc'>Choephoroi.</span></h3>

<p class='c018'>There is no proof at hand that epic literature knew
aught of Elektra or the part which she played in
avenging her father’s murder. The fragments from
the lyric poet Stesichoros furnish the oldest literary
source for the <cite>Oresteia</cite> which became later so popular
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>under the hands of the fifth-century tragedians. The
trilogy of Aischylos which has happily come down to
us is, therefore, the oldest extant authority. When one
turns to works of art one discovers a series of vase
paintings representing the death of Aigisthos; yet these
are but a little older than Aischylos’ work<a id='r118' /><a href='#f118' class='c020'><sup>[118]</sup></a>. Events
concerned with Orestes’ return are even less common in
early art. The Melan terra cotta <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">plaque</span></i> in the Louvre,
which represents a scene somewhat similar to the
opening of the <cite>Choephoroi</cite>, is the oldest of the <cite>Oresteia</cite>
monuments, but still must be dated within the fifth
century <span class='fss'>B.C.</span><a id='r119' /><a href='#f119' class='c020'><sup>[119]</sup></a> It may be considered as fairly well
established that Elektra and Orestes first appeared in
art but a few years before the production of Aischylos’
trilogy in 458 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span> Nor is it possible, so far as I know,
to discover any influence of the <cite>Agamemnon</cite> or <cite>Choephoroi</cite>
upon artistic productions in the last half of the
century. A small group of vase paintings from Lower
Italy belonging to the fourth century <span class='fss'>B.C.</span> do, however,
present situations which one may well believe to have
been suggested by the early part of the <cite>Choephoroi</cite>.</p>

<p><span class='sc'>Fig.</span> 1.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The painting shown in fig. 1<a id='r120' /><a href='#f120' class='c020'><sup>[120]</sup></a> represents a tomb, the
base of which is decorated with triglyphs. Surmounting
this is a stele, crowned with a Corinthian helm, and
bearing the name <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ΑΓΑΜΕ[Μ]ΝΩΝ</span>. Sitting with her
back to the stele on the left is Elektra, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ΕΛΕΚΤΡ[Α</span>,
wearing a chiton and mantle and clasping her left knee
in a meditative mood; beside her is another female
figure similarly dressed and holding a toilet box in the
left arm, an unusually common article on the vases of
Lower Italy. Perhaps the box is meant to recall the
offerings which were brought in it to the grave. This
person is not necessarily Chrysothemis, although her dress
would be more appropriate for Elektra’s sister than
for her attendant. It is, however, the work of the latter
to carry such a box of offerings for Elektra. The figure
may therefore be left unnamed. Her face is turned
towards Orestes, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ΟΡΕΣΤΗΣ</span>, who stands on the right
and appears to be speaking to Elektra, who pays no
attention to his words or his gesture. He is in travelling
costume, chlamys, petasos, and carries a spear and
sword, but curiously enough wears no boots. Below
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>him to the right in a similar attitude stands Pylades.
He has simply a chlamys and a spear. Another youth
sits above on a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">terrain</span></i>. He serves to round out the
picture, and indicates at the same time the attendants
of Orestes. In the background are a sword and shield;
on the grave is an amphora, as an offering, exactly the
shape of the vase on which the painting occurs. There
are numerous restorations in the work, but the main part
seems to be antique. Heydemann states that the inscription
on the stele is genuine, and also <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ΕΛΕΚΤΡ[Α</span>.
Doubt is expressed concerning <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ΟΡΕΣΤΗΣ</span>.</p>

<p class='c009'>We have before us the grave of Agamemnon, at which
the first 585 verses of the <cite>Choephoroi</cite> were played.
There is no trace of palace or royal building. Orestes,
accompanied by Pylades, enters the orchestra and lays
his tribute upon his father’s tomb, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τύμβου δ’ ἐπ’ ὄχθῳ</span>
(v. 4), but suddenly withdraws to avoid the company of
women which approaches with ceremonial step. The
chorus and Elektra proceed to perform their services
when the latter discovers the lock of hair, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἄγαλμα
τύμβου</span> (v. 200), and the footprints—two proofs that
Orestes must be near. While she is still examining the
tracks the latter comes up and proves beyond a doubt,
by pointing to the garment that Elektra had once
woven, who he is (vs. 212–232). Perhaps one may
think of Elektra as sitting upon the grave at some
point between v. 84 and v. 212, but when she had
discovered the traces of Orestes’ presence, she must
have been actively scanning the surroundings. It pleased
the artist, however, to represent her as ignoring the
appeal of her brother, or at least manifesting no signs
of recognizing him. But for the presence of the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τύμβος</span>
one would be inclined to see the influence of Sophokles’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span><cite>Elektra</cite>, where Orestes’ words gain credence very slowly,
and where Elektra hesitates long, before believing his
assertions that he is living and standing before her
(v. 1219 ff.). But the Sophoklean tragedy is played
before the palace. The pedagogue and Orestes leave
the orchestra to pour their libations on the grave
(v. 82 ff.) when Elektra comes out of the house. The
fact that the recognition scene is represented as taking
place at the grave gives us therefore ample reason for
accepting our painting as under the influence of the
<cite>Choephoroi</cite>. This painting is strikingly free in its conception;
no words of the poet can be cited as fitting
the situation. The suggestion, the setting, are Aischylean;
all else is the artist’s. The work is far removed
from the character of an illustration.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>The second painting is on a Lucanian hydria<a id='r121' /><a href='#f121' class='c020'><sup>[121]</sup></a>. The
central scene is again the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τύμβος</span> of Agamemnon, built
up with several steps and surmounted by a stele with
Ionic capital and bound by a fillet. Elektra sits upon
the upper step in veil and chiton. She holds the former
with her right hand and looks away into space. On
other steps below her are a lekythos and other small
vases, also a pomegranate and a fillet. The offerings are
much more abundant here than in fig. 1. Unnoticed
by his sister, Orestes approaches the stele on the left,
dressed as in fig. 1, with the addition of boots. He
is about to pour a libation from a kylix in his left hand.
The male figure sitting next to him is doubtless Pylades.
He turns his head towards the main scene. The remaining
figure here is but remotely associated with the
action. The persons on the right are more interesting.
The youth standing on the step of the grave about to
lay a wreath upon the stele is denoted by his kerykeion
as Hermes. He wears a travelling costume without the
usual boots. An elderly, bearded, male figure stands
behind him. He is not characterized except by a mantle
and a long staff, but has been interpreted as Orestes’
pedagogue. The only objection to this is his dress<a id='r122' /><a href='#f122' class='c020'><sup>[122]</sup></a>,
but this may be due to the carelessness of the artist.
Behind him is another bearded male figure sitting upon
a sort of bag, or pack. His short chiton, shoes, and
staff all point him out as a traveller. The peculiar,
close-fitting cap denotes him as a foreigner. The female
figure on the extreme right in Doric peplos carries an
aryballos in her left hand, and gazes at the group before
her. Perhaps she belongs to Elektra.</p>

<p class='c009'>The discussion of fig. 1 above applies equally well
to Orestes and Elektra here. We have practically a
repetition of the group. The former figure is, however,
thought of at an earlier moment. By removing Elektra
one may think of Orestes at the opening of the play.
He holds the vase in his hand rather than the lock of
hair. The first words of the prologue are suggestive—</p>

<div class='lg-container-l c021'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ἑρμῆ χθόνιε πατρῷ’ ἐποπτεύων κράτη,</span></div>
      <div class='line'><span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">σωτὴρ γενοῦ μοι ξύμμαχός τ’ αἰτουμένῳ</span>.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c022'>Chthonian Hermes, who guards the ancestral rights,
has really manifested himself in the painting, and has
appeared as a particular ally. The act of crowning the
stele declares Hermes’ friendliness toward the family
and his interest in Agamemnon’s shade. Elektra addresses
him also and beseeches him to hear her supplications
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>and pity her and her dear Orestes (v. 124 ff.).
We may note, therefore, a special fitness in the artist’s
expressing this double relation of Hermes to the children.
Invoked by both of them as a protecting god he introduces
nothing that is not in harmony with the spirit
of Aischylos. The addition of this figure is, moreover,
a good instance of the liberty which the vase painters
took with their authors, and shows well the difference
between illustration and independent work. It cannot
be denied that with the assistance of this monument
one is led to see between the lines of the <cite>Choephoroi</cite>.
The pedagogue who does not appear in Aischylos is
nevertheless a natural extension of the group. It will
be remembered that he speaks the prologue in the
<cite>Elektra</cite> of Sophokles and occupies the place which
Pylades usually fills. In Euripides’ <cite>Elektra</cite> (v. 16),
Autourgos says that Orestes had been given into the
charge of a <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τροφεύς</span>. The person resting on the pack
appears at first sight a gratuitous addition of the artist,
but on closer examination the suggestion for him is found
in the poet. When Orestes explains to the chorus that
he and Pylades will attempt to gain an entrance to
the palace, he states that they will disguise themselves
as foreigners by speaking the Phokean dialect
(v. 563 f.). To Klytaimestra’s interrogations (v. 668 ff.)
he replies—</p>

<p class='c022'>In other words, he is a stranger from Phokis who has
to carry his own pack. It is upon this <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">σαγή</span> that the
figure is resting. The artist has characterized him as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>a foreigner by the peculiar cap. No Greek ever wore
such a head-dress. The make-up hints at the appearance
of Orestes seeking admittance to the palace, while,
of course, the person is to be understood merely as one
of the latter’s servants. Whatever he may have said
about carrying his own pack, no artist would have
thus represented him. On the oldest of the Orestes-Elektra
monuments, the Melan relief<a id='r123' /><a href='#f123' class='c020'><sup>[123]</sup></a>, there is such a
figure standing behind Orestes with his luggage strapped
to his shoulders. It seems to me that the painter has
naïvely caught up the spirit of the text and brought in
a figure which goes far towards adding a charm and
interest to the scene.</p>

<p class='c009'>Another Lucanian hydria representing the same scene
is published here for the first time, in fig. 3<a id='r124' /><a href='#f124' class='c020'><sup>[124]</sup></a>. It will be
more instructive to point out the few points in which
the two paintings differ from each other than to describe
this one entire. The column in 3 has a Doric capital,
with maeander and checker-board ornament; in 2 the
capital is Ionic. In 3 Hermes stands on the ground;
in 2 he stands on the step to the grave. Elektra reaches
out her left hand in 3 as though to receive the libation;
in 2 she is unmindful of Orestes. The latter holds a kylix
in 2, and in 3 a pitcher. His hat is a pilos in 3, and he
wears it; in 2 the petasos hangs on the back of his neck.
The Phokean attendant sitting upon the luggage is
in 3 upon the left, and in 2 upon the right. There is an
extraordinary likeness between the two. There is the
same crooked nose, short chiton, and odd cap, but
the latter has no tassel in 3. The servant wears, besides,
a chlamys and rests his stick over his leg. Behind him
is the nude youth, as in 2, upon the left, holding an
ointment vase in a sort of carrier. The two male figures
of 2 adjoining the main scene are wanting in 3. In
their stead is a female figure sitting upon a stool and
holding a large toilet box. She is dressed in a Doric
peplos with an <em>apoptygma</em>. She is evidently an attendant
of Elektra, and reminds one strongly of the figure in
fig. 1. Behind her is the charming girl, exactly as in 2,
except that she carries the aryballos in her right, and in
the left hand a small box.</p>

<p>Fig. 3 (<em>vid. p. <a href='#Page_51'>51</a> ff.</em>).</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>The painting is, it would seem, more beautiful than
that of fig. 2, although the publication of the latter
is an old one, and may be more or less inaccurate.
I have not seen the vase myself. The scene is abbreviated
by one figure; Pylades would be expected.</p>

<p class='c009'>Still another painting is given in fig. 4<a id='r125' /><a href='#f125' class='c020'><sup>[125]</sup></a>, showing a
further step of simplification. Only the middle group,
with the female attendant carrying the aryballos, occurs.
Hermes’ position is the same as in fig. 2, but the artist
has forgotten to draw the wreath in his right. His chlamys,
too, is buttoned properly instead of being wrapped
around his arm. The latter, however, has the same
stumpy appearance seen in 2 and 3. As the scene is
simpler, so the offerings on the tomb are fewer. Orestes’
libation is here in a kantharos. The painting is a careless
piece of work, and cannot be ranked with the other two.
It is, however, very interesting as giving another link to
the chain of evidence.</p>

<p class='c009'>There can be little doubt that these vases all belong
to the same artist or that they come from the same
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>locality. The marvellous agreement that runs through
them is something quite extraordinary. I know of
no other similar cases in vase paintings of the red
figured ware. The popularity of this scene, and therefore
of Aischylos’ <cite>Choephoroi</cite>, is attested by such a series
of paintings as one cannot find in the case of any other
work in Greek literature.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id003'>
<img src='images/i_p054.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p>Fig. 4.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Since writing the above I have discovered in the
Louvre another Lucanian vase that represents a further
simplification of this scene<a id='r126' /><a href='#f126' class='c020'><sup>[126]</sup></a>. The painting is practically
identical with the middle group in fig. 3. Peculiar to
the Louvre painting are the tomb with five steps and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>the rather tall column, Doric order, surmounted by a
krater; an aryballos and strigil, in addition to the
taenia, are fastened to the column. There is a further
slight variation in Elektra’s position, for on her right
is a krater. On her left is a lekythos; below are the
two pomegranates, taenia, and black lekythos, just as in
fig. 3. The only difference in the other persons is that
Orestes holds out a kylix and not a pitcher.</p>

<p class='c009'>The painting is evidently a product of the same studio
as are those in figs. 2, 3 and 4. It forms another
member of this remarkable class of pictures that stands
alone, unique in Greek ceramics, and bears witness to
the enormous popularity of this scene from Aischylos.
In the face of this important chain of evidence one is
safe, it seems to me, in claiming that Aischylos was
acted in the fourth century <span class='fss'>B.C.</span> and that considerably.
What kept this scene before the public and induced the
artist and his pupils to turn out so many copies of the
same work? To have been thus so saleable the picture
must have been popular, and this could have come about
best through the acted drama. These vases and those
following, based on the <cite><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Eumenides</span></cite>, must impress the
impartial student with the fact that Euripides and
Sophokles did not by any means oust Aischylos completely
in Lower Italy.</p>

<h3 class='c019'>§ 3. <span class='sc'>Eumenides.</span></h3>

<p class='c018'>The various stories which may have been popularly
told in regard to Orestes’ purification, and his reconciliation
with the Furies, prior to March 458 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span> were
swept for ever into oblivion by the last member of
Aischylos’ trilogy. The stamp of his genius has ever
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>remained upon the myth, and no one ever attempted to
repeat his work<a id='r127' /><a href='#f127' class='c020'><sup>[127]</sup></a>. All the elements of the persecution
were cast by him into their final mould. The immense
influence of this work is attested in no way more forcibly
than by the monuments of art to which one can point.
There is a long line of vase paintings, dating from the
fifth century, that bear witness to the wide popularity
of the <cite><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Eumenides</span></cite>, and that give the most direct and
authoritative testimony of the influence of the play upon
the masses of the people. A sharp distinction must be
made, however, between paintings that illustrate the
general myth and those that exhibit unmistakable
Aischylean features. Orestes’ pursuit and expiation
were universally known, and the tale was so popular
that it often found its way into art where the artist
had in mind no poetic version of the story. So it is
that there is a number of paintings representing Orestes
either pursued by the Furies or already having reached
the omphalos, which do not represent any situation
or combination of situations that can be traced to
Aischylos<a id='r128' /><a href='#f128' class='c020'><sup>[128]</sup></a>. Of the number whose subject is Orestes
at Delphi, at least four, it seems to me, are to be explained
as substantially under the influence of the <cite><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Eumenides</span></cite>
and representing the first scene of the tragedy in more
or less modified form.</p>

<p class='c009'>I discuss first the scene on the St. Petersburg krater<a id='r129' /><a href='#f129' class='c020'><sup>[129]</sup></a>,
fig. 5. The painting belongs to the latest period of
ceramic art, and is in nearly every detail a hasty and
careless piece of work. In an Ionic temple on four
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>columns, all painted white, Orestes, flesh dark red, sits
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en face</span></i> with his left arm around the omphalos which
is covered with a white net. He holds the sword in
the right and the sheath in the left, and wears boots and
chlamys. On the steps of the temple lie five sleeping
Furies. They are painted, flesh black, only in rough
outline. Their dress is a short chiton. On the right,
hastening from the temple, is the Pythia in long chiton
and veil. She carries the big key—emblem of her office
as <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κλῃδοῦχος</span><a id='r130' /><a href='#f130' class='c020'><sup>[130]</sup></a>. Her flesh is white.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id003'>
<img src='images/i_p057.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p>Fig. 5.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>The addition of the temple strikes one at once as
being in harmony with the poet. To be sure, this need
not mean a particularly close relation with the actual
production of the play in a Greek theatre. Our temple
is merely one of the numerous buildings of this class
found upon the vases of Lower Italy, some of which
were intended evidently as suggestions of the stage
setting. In the present instance the coincidence is
a happy one. The <cite>Agamemnon</cite> and the <cite>Choephoroi</cite>,
which had just been produced, were both played before
the palace at Argos, and this scenery was changed to
represent the Apollo temple at Delphi for the third play.
There can be no question as to this <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">σκηνή</span> for the <cite>Oresteia</cite>,
at least, even though one does not allow an extensive
background for the earlier plays. The painting is well
adapted, therefore, for placing the opening scene vividly
before us. It brings one closer to the meaning of the
text than is apparent at first sight. In v. 1048 ff. of
the <cite>Choephoroi</cite> Orestes saw the Furies. They wore bright
chitons, and had snakes in their hair. He calls them
hounds from whose eyes oozed ugly drops of blood.
The chorus evidently did not see them, for Orestes
cries, ‘You do not behold them here, but I do’.<a id='r131' /><a href='#f131' class='c020'><sup>[131]</sup></a> At
these words he is away to Delphi to seek Apollo’s
protection. During the intermission which followed
between the two plays the necessary alterations were
made in the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">σκηνή</span> and the costumes were changed.
The chorus in particular, which had represented Argive
maidens, underwent considerable transformation in order
to appear again as Furies. The <cite><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Eumenides</span></cite> is opened
by the Pythia, who comes from the temple. She
recounts the nature of her duties, and mentions various
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>gods in her address until v. 30, at which point she turns
from the orchestra to re-enter the temple and attend to
the delivery of responses. In a moment she reappears
in great fright, and begins to relate the cause of her
alarm. The sight described is exactly that which the
painter had in mind. One is able, however, to get
behind the scenes with the aid of the picture, for the
front of the temple is removed so that the interior is
plainly in view. To compare the words of Aischylos
and the painting more closely—the Pythia says that
a terrible sight drove her <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐκ δόμων τῶν Λοξίου</span><a id='r132' /><a href='#f132' class='c020'><sup>[132]</sup></a>. The
artist has expressed this with some action, for she is
actually represented as leaving ‘the house of Loxias.’
She adds further—</p>

      <div class='line'><span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὁρῶ δ’ ἐπ’ ὀμφαλῷ μὲν ἄνδρα θεομυσῆ</span></div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c022'>The picture shows the man upon the omphalos, and in
his hand the drawn sword. One may imagine that the
suppliant’s hands are stained with blood, when but a short
time before he had fled from the scene of the murder in
Argos. Even greater explicitness characterizes the next
words of the priestess:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-l c021'>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c022'>Surely a ‘marvellous troop of women’ fits the group
which we see before us. In this particular the work is
practically an illustration of the text. The distinction
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>is at once made that the figures are not women nor
Gorgons nor Harpies<a id='r133' /><a href='#f133' class='c020'><sup>[133]</sup></a>. They are <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἄπτεροι</span> and <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μέλαιναι</span>,
and snore with unapproachable blasts. It should be
noted that the figures in the painting are also black,
as though in direct agreement with Aischylos<a id='r134' /><a href='#f134' class='c020'><sup>[134]</sup></a>. They
are further wingless, while the unpleasant details added
are conceivable from the appearance of the ugly creatures.
The number five is of course a mere accident. They lie
here in an unconscious stupour till the ghost of Klytaimestra
arouses them again. The <cite><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Eumenides</span></cite> is, as is well
known, the only extant Greek tragedy in which the
chorus is not visible from the beginning of their part.
In the <cite>Persai</cite> and <cite>Supplices</cite> of Aischylos and the
<cite>Bakchai</cite> and <cite>Supplices</cite> of Euripides the chorus is, however,
in the orchestra when the play opens.</p>

<p class='c009'>There are still two other vase paintings to be considered
in this connexion. They present minor variations
from the one just discussed, but on the whole the
three betray a common source. In fig. 6<a id='r135' /><a href='#f135' class='c020'><sup>[135]</sup></a> one sees
also the interior of the temple represented by three
Ionic columns. Various dedicatory articles hang from
the wall and ceiling. Further indications of the sanctuary
are the two tripods, the laurel tree, and the
omphalos. Orestes, characterized as usual by the
drawn sword and flying chlamys, has fled to the latter
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>and embraces it. His erect hair shows his fright.
Apollo with bow and arrows hastens behind him and
gestures with his right hand to drive back a Fury who is
swooping down upon Orestes. She is but half in sight,
and wears a short Doric peplos, and her flesh is black.
The Pythia, with dishevelled gray hair and frightened
mien, quits the sanctuary on the left. Her key, indistinctly
drawn in Jahn’s publication, owing probably to
the copyist’s ignorance of what the article really was,
has just fallen from her hands. Artemis in her huntress-costume,
carrying two spears, stands on tiptoe on the
right of the omphalos and shades her eyes with her
right hand as she peers at the disturbance. Two dogs
are with her.</p>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>Fig. 6</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The time of the Pythia’s exit from the temple, as in
fig. 5, and the later moment when Apollo orders the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>Erinyes from the sanctuary, are well combined in this
painting:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-l c021'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἔξω, κελεύω, τῶνδε δωμάτων τάχος</span></div>

      <div class='line in36'>vs. 179 ff.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c022'>Apollo’s authoritative bearing and absolute power in
his own precinct are very well brought out by the artist.
One can all but hear the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἔξω, κελεύω</span> of Aischylos, and
the arrows that the god holds in his left hand seem to
show that Apollo is quite ready to carry out his threat.
The whole is, moreover, dramatically told, and in this
respect the stage influence is easily traceable in the painting.
That the Fury is black accords again with the
poet’s <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μέλαιναι</span> (v. 52). The presence of Artemis lends
a certain charm that one can attribute to the artist’s
desire to appear original<a id='r136' /><a href='#f136' class='c020'><sup>[136]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c009'>The following work falls still further away from the
scenery of the play. Fig. 7 shows a painting on the neck
of a large Apulian amphora in Berlin<a id='r137' /><a href='#f137' class='c020'><sup>[137]</sup></a>. The limited
space, and the secondary position likewise, have perhaps
curtailed the scope of the work. No architectural details
are given. The sanctuary is denoted by the omphalos
and the tripod. Orestes has sought protection at the
former, as in the preceding scenes, and looks back at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>a Fury, with short dress and huge wings, who runs toward
him with a dagger in her right and a burning torch in
the left hand. Apollo, who sits upon the tripod, a laurel
bough in his hand and wreath in his hair, extends his
right hand to repel the Fury as in fig. 6. On the right
the Pythia, dressed as in fig. 5, leaves the shrine in
fright, gesturing at the unexpected visitors. The painter
has forgotten to give her the key. Beside her is an
attendant carrying a sort of kylix in the left hand and
looking back at the sanctuary.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id003'>
<img src='images/i_p063.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p>Fig. 7.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>It does not appear necessary to take up the details
here after the examination which has been given to the
preceding paintings. The artist’s debt to Aischylos was
quite as direct as in the case of the two other works.
The greatest modification occurs in the figure of the
Fury, which is a being far removed from the Aischylean
type.</p>

<p class='c009'>A painting on a bell-shaped krater in the Louvre is
less hampered by the scene given in Aischylos, and
is accordingly more artistic<a id='r138' /><a href='#f138' class='c020'><sup>[138]</sup></a>. The inventiveness and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>individuality of the artist come prominently to view,
and the result is an intensely interesting composition.
The combination of events and the manner in which all
is told bring one a great deal nearer to the deeper
meaning of <cite><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Eumenides</span></cite> than any other monument with
which I am acquainted.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id003'>
<img src='images/i_p064.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p>Fig. 8.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The shrine of Apollo, the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μυχός</span> of vs. 39 and 170, is
denoted by a platform on two steps, above which are the
laurel tree and the omphalos. The god stands to the left
in large, embroidered chiton or chlamys, grasping the
tree with his left hand and extending his right, in which
is a young pig, over the head of Orestes, who sits with
his back to the omphalos. The latter holds his sword in
his right hand, which is raised meditatively to his chin.
Artemis stands behind the platform on the right, characterized
by her costume and the spears. In the left-hand
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>upper corner the shade of Klytaimestra, veiled, is
engaged in arousing two Furies who sit fast asleep. She
points toward Apollo with her right hand. Below is
the half-figure of another Fury apparently rising out of
the ground wide-awake. The Erinyes are all dressed
like Artemis, in short costume and high boots.</p>

<p class='c009'>The artist has combined with the first scene a moment
earlier than the action of the play. Orestes’ expiation
preceded the prologue of the Pythia. The purificatory
rite had been performed immediately on his arrival at
Delphi, for, when he first appears in the <cite><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Eumenides</span></cite>, he
is undefiled. This is plainly declared to Athena in
vs. 237 ff., and to the Chorus and Athena in vs. 280 ff.
While the purification is represented in various ways
upon the other vase paintings<a id='r139' /><a href='#f139' class='c020'><sup>[139]</sup></a>, this ceremony is the
only one that reminds us of Aischylos. The latter
hints at the manner of the rite, and this passage has
unquestionably suggested the group which we have
before us:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-l c021'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ποταίνιον γὰρ ὂν πρὸς ἑστίᾳ θεοῦ</span></div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c022'>‘While the blood was fresh it was cleansed at the shrine
of the god Phoibos by purification with the blood of
pigs.’ The ceremony is referred to again in</p>

<div class='lg-container-l c021'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">σφαγαὶ καθαιμάξωσι νεοθήλου βοτοῦ.</span>  v. 450.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c022'>There is, therefore, in the painting a representation of
this service with pig’s blood. The freshness and beauty
of the scene are peculiar to works of art in the Pheidian
age, and the painting must be considered as a valuable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>witness of Aischylos’ influence. The fact that the work
is Apulian and not Attic supplies an interesting bit of
evidence for the extension of Athenian literature in
Lower Italy during the fifth century <span class='fss'>B.C.</span> Tarentum,
which was scarcely less Athenian than Athens, received
an edition of the plays brought out at the Greater
Dionysia soon after their appearance in Athens. It is
further to be remembered that Aischylos’ long connexion
with Syracuse had probably made him more
widely known in the West than was either Sophokles or
Euripides during the fifth century. Our vase belongs to
the last decades of the century, perhaps as early as
420 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>, and in this period Euripides had scarcely gained
a large following in Magna Graecia.</p>

<p class='c009'>Apollo’s speech follows directly upon that of the
Pythia’s. How the god appeared in the orchestra is
a question on which scholars are not agreed. The most
widely accepted view is that the ekkyklema was brought
into use, and that on it the whole company was in some
manner rolled or pushed out from the temple to the
orchestra. This means that the chorus of twelve or
fifteen, together with Orestes, Apollo, and Hermes, was
moved bodily forward from the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">σκηνή</span>, far enough at
least to give the audience a glimpse of what had been
the interior of the temple with all its surroundings.
Apollo seems to speak of the Furies and Orestes as
though he himself saw them and as though the audience
could see them<a id='r140' /><a href='#f140' class='c020'><sup>[140]</sup></a>. They are in fact in plain view if one
insists upon the literal meaning of his words. It is argued
on the other hand that such a ponderous weight could
not have been moved by any machinery at Aischylos’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>command. In other words, the ekkyklema, in the interpretation
usually given the term, is not to be counted
apart of the Aischylean scenic apparatus<a id='r141' /><a href='#f141' class='c020'><sup>[141]</sup></a>. If Apollo
stood in the doorway of the temple where he could look
in upon the Furies and Orestes, and at the same time be
seen by the audience, one has really no need of any
machinery. The shade of Klytaimestra must also be
thought of as appearing in the same place. She glances
in upon the Furies who continue to give forth their grunts
till v. 140, when they for the first time appear in the
orchestra. There is much in favour of this explanation
of the arrangements for the scene. Fortunately for our
purpose it makes little difference which of the two
opinions one follows. Conclusive evidence is hardly to
be reached either one way or the other, yet the notion
that Aischylos did not employ such extensive machinery
as the ekkyklema must have been certainly does not
harmonize either with the extant plays or with the
tradition in regard to Aischylos’ inventions. My conviction
is that from v. 64 the interior of the temple was
in some way visible, and that the whole audience could
see Orestes at the omphalos, surrounded by the slumbering
Furies. The god reassures the suppliant of his
support, and bids him leave for Athens and embrace
the sacred image of Athena. He turns to Hermes, who
is at hand for the occasion, and bids him accompany
Orestes. At this point, v. 93, the two quit the orchestra,
Orestes passing over the bodies of the Furies<a id='r142' /><a href='#f142' class='c020'><sup>[142]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>Our painting follows the development in vs. 94–140,
where the shade of Klytaimestra appears and chides
the Erinyes for neglecting their duty and forgetting her
and her rights. The artist has grasped the spirit of the
poet, and has given a graphic account of the scene such
as one is not likely to forget. The dread figure of the
veiled ghost, who glances searchingly at the sleeping
instruments of her vengeance and endeavours to rouse
them into consciousness, is a creation but little inferior
to that in Aischylos<a id='r143' /><a href='#f143' class='c020'><sup>[143]</sup></a>. Her position on the extreme
limits of the sanctuary serves to express the uncleanliness
of the spirit and the incongruity of its appearing within
the sacred ground. The gesture towards the main group
connects the two scenes and lends a unity to the whole.
This is real art and no illustration. One must remember
that Orestes is at this time on his way to Athens, and
that the shade did not appear in his presence. The very
fact that the painter chose to unite the two moments
adds greatly to the general effect. The tragedy is played
in part before us. The number of Furies representing
the chorus is the same that one meets first in Euripides<a id='r144' /><a href='#f144' class='c020'><sup>[144]</sup></a>,
and that is particularly emphasized also by Aischylos in</p>

<p class='c022'>Their dress is that of the later type of Erinyes—the
huntress-costume of Artemis. This facilitated their
motion. Perhaps the half-figure of the awakened Fury
may be rising from the earth to continue the pursuit,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>but it seems to me more probable that the half-figure is
such from choice. After the appearance of the Erinyes
in the <cite>Choephoroi</cite> they are certainly above ground till
conducted to their new home under the Areopagos.</p>

<p class='c009'>While the story of Agamemnon’s murder and the
succeeding terrible revenge wrought by Orestes, as well
as the latter’s atonement at Delphi, were all a part of the
legendary inheritance from a very early period and had
played for some centuries, at least, before Aischylos
an important rôle in the epic<a id='r145' /><a href='#f145' class='c020'><sup>[145]</sup></a> and lyric<a id='r146' /><a href='#f146' class='c020'><sup>[146]</sup></a> literature, it
remained for the great tragedian to break new ground
for the last chapter of the <cite>Oresteia</cite>. Orestes’ acquittal
and deliverance were, prior to Aischylos, distinctly
Delphic in setting; in his hands all became decidedly
Athenian. Apollo had once been the sole divinity to
absolve the murderer; Athena became the new arbiter
and director of the case. The temple at Delphi gave
way to the ‘Old Temple’ of Athena upon the Acropolis.
Keeping these facts in mind, one has to look about for
vase paintings which show traces of this Attic turn. So
far, only the early scene at Delphi has claimed our attention,
and here it has been possible to point out several
compositions that demand the <cite><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Eumenides</span></cite> to the exclusion
of popular tradition.</p>

<p class='c009'>From v. 235 the scene is transferred from Delphi to
Athens, and remains throughout the rest of the play
the ‘Old Temple’ on the Acropolis<a id='r147' /><a href='#f147' class='c020'><sup>[147]</sup></a>. Athena becomes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>the centre. Everything moves about her. The one
impressive figure in this part of the tragedy is the
goddess. Orestes is simply a poor helpless mortal—the
apparent subject of the action. He and the Erinyes
sink into insignificance when compared with the majestic
figure of Athena. Substantial traces of the influence of
Aischylos’ invention have reached us on the vases.
A small number of paintings claim the right to be considered
under this head. The composition of all (I know
three such) is so similar that it seemed necessary to
reproduce only one.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>The painting shown in fig. 9<a id='r148' /><a href='#f148' class='c020'><sup>[148]</sup></a> represents the sanctuary
at Delphi with the tripod and the omphalos; kneeling
upon the latter is Orestes, in the same costume as that
noticed in the preceding monuments, holding two spears
in addition to the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">νεοσπαδὲς ξίφος</span>. He glances up to
the right, where Athena looks down upon him. Her
right foot rests on a sort of plinth; she carries a double-pointed
spear in her left hand and wears a Corinthian helm
with peculiar crest<a id='r149' /><a href='#f149' class='c020'><sup>[149]</sup></a>. Her dress is an embroidered Ionic
chiton and large aigis. The latter is not uncommon
on the fourth-century vases, and is characteristic of the
exaggeration of types in this period. Apollo stands
on the left of the omphalos, with a laurel branch on
which are hung fillets and <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πινάκια</span><a id='r150' /><a href='#f150' class='c020'><sup>[150]</sup></a>. He looks to
the left at a winged Fury with a very elaborate costume,
a huge serpent about her body and one in her hair;
above the tripod is the bust of another Fury on
whom are four snakes. In the left-hand upper corner
a bust of a youth with chlamys, pilos, and a spear
is most likely meant for Pylades. Corresponding to
this on the other side are the head and shoulders of
a woman, interpreted as Klytaimestra.</p>

<p class='c009'>The two other vase paintings are, in the main, close
counterparts of this and need not be described here.
The Vatican amphora<a id='r151' /><a href='#f151' class='c020'><sup>[151]</sup></a> is particularly interesting as
representing Athena with aigis extended over Orestes
to protect him from the Furies. The Capua hydria in
Berlin<a id='r152' /><a href='#f152' class='c020'><sup>[152]</sup></a> takes precedence over the other two in age, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>furnishes us with the nearest approach to Aischylos’
time. It falls within the fifth century, while the others
are to be placed in the last half of the fourth century.</p>

<p class='c009'>The introduction of Athena is the unmistakable sign.
She intervenes at Delphi simply because Aischylos
introduced her in Athens. The artist transferred her to
Delphi and combined the two scenes of the tragedy.
If one considers only Orestes and Athena in fig. 9, and
reads the interview between them in the <cite><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Eumenides</span></cite>,
he will appreciate at once how well the painter has
managed his task. The whole make-up of the figures
is that of stage characters. This is especially noticeable
in the dresses of the Fury and Athena. This elegance
and finery on vases of the fourth century were widely
regulated by dramatic performances.</p>

<p class='c009'>The set of paintings which thus associates Athena
with Orestes’ delivery may be counted as the direct
product of the <cite><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Eumenides</span></cite>, and therefore important
witnesses for the influence of Aischylos upon the succeeding
century of Greek art.</p>

<h3 class='c019'>§ 4. <span class='sc'>The lost Plays.</span></h3>

<p class='c018'>One might carry on a long and fruitless discussion
concerning certain of the lost plays, and paintings that
present subjects common to them. It must be all but
‘fruitless,’ since we know next to nothing about the
character of some of these tragedies, as, for example,
the <cite>Pentheus</cite>. But this whole question lies outside the
province of the present work, and I shall not go further
than to append a list of the vase paintings that do in all
probability owe much to Aischylos.</p>

  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER IV<br /> <span class='large'>SOPHOKLES AND HIS RELATION TO VASE PAINTING</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Sophokles appears to have enjoyed together with
Euripides a large share of popularity in the fourth and
third centuries, and it is well known that with the Roman
tragedians he was a very important factor. It must be
held as passing strange that we can point to but few
monuments inspired by him. One feels that there is
abundant material in the <cite>Antigone</cite>, for example, to have
aroused both painters and sculptors, and yet there is, so
far as I know, no trace in Greek art of any Antigone
scene that owes its existence to Sophokles. It is,
however, true that tragedies which were known in ancient
times as among the most celebrated, and which are to-day
counted the masterpieces of Greek tragedy, were often
particularly neglected by the artists. How meagre is
the record of monuments based on the <cite>Prometheus</cite>, the
<cite>Ion</cite>, or the <cite>Oedipus Rex</cite>! The reputation of a play
cannot be taken as any guaranty, therefore, that the
artist found in it the required motives. The gentle and
calm Sophokles, who ‘made men as they ought to be and
not as they are,’ wrote in a grand and dignified manner
that charmed the people of his own time and won the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>praise and admiration of all posterity. How then is
one to account for the small part that he played in
ancient art? It seems to me that it rests on the fact
that Sophokles was not a creative power. Say what
we may of the elegance and grace of his style and the
perfection of his diction, a glance at his extant work
convinces us that he seldom allowed his imagination
to carry him beyond the bounds of the accepted form
of a myth. He preserved the mythological fabric with
religious fervour and altered little. He was neither an
iconoclast nor an innovator. The gods and heroes in
their old-time relations to each other and to humanity
served him fully, and he showed an unwillingness either
to shatter the popular faith or to disturb it with new
doctrines. So long, therefore, as nothing new mythologically
was introduced, the value of the Sophoklean
plays, from an artist’s point of view, was far below the
fresh and dashing manner of Euripides, who left the old
and beaten paths and added new chapters to the lives
of the heroes and the exploits of the gods. It has
already been observed that where Aischylos broke new
ground he was followed by the painter and sculptor.
The novelty of the <cite><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Eumenides</span></cite> appealed to the artist
even more strongly than to the public; here was
something absolutely new, unheard of before. So it
was with the <cite>Choephoroi</cite>, and we have already seen that
of the extant plays these two are the only ones that
influenced vase painting. Had Sophokles grafted new
branches on the old trees of myths he would likewise
have had a far larger following among ancient artists.
As it is, it does not seem possible to point to a single
vase painting that is indisputably a Sophoklean product,
and one must be perplexed by the strange problem.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>To be sure conjectures have not been wanting, and here
and there a painting has been named in connexion with
Sophokles. But this is by no means a frequent occurrence,
and there has never been any consensus of opinion
among archaeologists that this or that picture <em>must</em> be
the outgrowth of one of his extant tragedies. I have
accordingly not published any painting under this head.
It seemed best merely to point out the few instances
where Sophoklean influences have been seen by some,
and leave the student free to determine each case for
himself<a id='r153' /><a href='#f153' class='c020'><sup>[153]</sup></a>.</p>

  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER V<br /> <span class='large'>EURIPIDES AND VASE PAINTING</span></h2>
</div>

<h3 class='c017'>§ 1. <span class='sc'>Introduction.</span></h3>

<p class='c018'>It has already been made clear that Euripides enjoyed
an enormous popularity among Greek and Italian artists,
and that he was the chief inspiration for works of art
based on tragedy. This latter feature assumes a new
interest when studied with the Greek vases. The great
majority of these paintings, as has been pointed out,
is to be placed within the fourth cent. <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>, and through
them one approaches very near to the poet’s own time.
They are to be valued, therefore, as most direct and
reliable testimony concerning Greek tragedy and the
place it occupied in the life of Lower Italy. Not a few
of the paintings published in the following pages may
have been seen by people who had known the Athenian
society in which Euripides himself had moved. This
proximity of the vases to the poet’s own day is an
important point, and should be thoroughly comprehended
in order to bring the true value of the paintings before
one. The text of a classical Greek author, exposed to
the emendatory zeal of the ancient grammarians and
the ignorance and carelessness of scribes, had a precarious
sort of existence before it was microscopically dissected
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>and violently revised by modern philologists. Our
oldest manuscript hardly goes back more than one-third
of the way to the original. Between 1000 <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> and
340 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>, when the archetype of the three tragedians
was ordered by Lykurgos, how long was the line of
copies! It is vastly different with the edition of the
<cite>Medeia</cite>, for example, on the amphora, p. <a href='#Page_145'>145</a>. The vase
relates the tragedy at first hand, and furnishes the student
with an exhibition of the play that is more than twenty-two
hundred years old. The original work and no copy
carries one into the century succeeding the first production
of the play. Such facts impress one with the
importance of this class of monuments.</p>

<p class='c009'>Before taking up the discussion of the vase paintings
that are under the influence of Euripides, it may be well
to examine for a moment the ancient testimony touching
the poet. It is well known that he did not follow the
orthodox form of tragic composition established by
Aischylos and adhered to by Sophokles. He was less
religious than either of the other two and, in the same
degree, more a man of the world. He was interested in
politics, rhetoric, and philosophy, and these elements
accordingly found room in his plays. For introducing
the common, ordinary affairs of daily life he was stoutly
condemned by Aristophanes. His policy continued the
same in spite of the virulent attacks of his enemies, and
the individual appealed to him more strongly than the
body politic; where the former poets had preached
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἦθος</span> and directed their messages to the world <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">καθ’ ὅλον</span>,
Euripides disclosed for the first time the power of <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πάθος</span>,
and that of itself was specific and applied to the community
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">καθ’ ἕκαστον</span>. Herein lay Aristotle’s unfavourable
criticism. The philosopher admired Homer, Aischylos,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>and Sophokles more than Euripides simply because he
considered <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἦθος</span> to be a more potent factor than <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πάθος</span>,
and so he complains that none of the younger poets have
the former<a id='r155' /><a href='#f155' class='c020'><sup>[155]</sup></a>. By <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">νέοι</span> he evidently meant post-Euripidean
writers, and yet there is no trace of the Aristotelian
conception of <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἦθος</span> in Euripides. We may imagine that
the great thinker looked for something more stable
than <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πάθος</span>. But this was all cold, calculating criticism,
and Aristotle appears, for the most part, alone in placing
Euripides below Aischylos and Sophokles. The Alexandrian
grammarians were his chief followers. Plato
found in Euripides an authority of great pre-eminence<a id='r156' /><a href='#f156' class='c020'><sup>[156]</sup></a>.
The immediate success that he enjoyed in his own time
is well illustrated by the anecdote related in Plutarch’s
<cite>Life of Nikias</cite><a id='r157' /><a href='#f157' class='c020'><sup>[157]</sup></a>. The fugitives from the Athenian army
in the Sicilian expedition are said to have maintained
themselves by reciting from Euripides’ works, and
captives were able to gain their freedom by teaching
their masters new selections from the Euripidean plays.
The element of truth in this remarkable story enables
one to understand something of the place held by this
poet in the West. It is related of Alexander that he
was particularly fond of Euripides, and that he performed
the feat of reciting a whole scene from the <cite>Andromeda</cite>
at his fatal banquet<a id='r158' /><a href='#f158' class='c020'><sup>[158]</sup></a>. A certain Axionikos wrote
a comedy called the ‘Lover of Euripides,’ in which he
represented the people as suffering from the Euripides-fad
to such an extent that they counted all other poetry
worthless<a id='r159' /><a href='#f159' class='c020'><sup>[159]</sup></a>. A fitting <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">finale</span></i> to all this is reached in the
story told in the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">vita</span></i> of Euripides to the effect that
Philemon would have been willing to hang himself if
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>thereby he might have seen Euripides. That he was
always in men’s mouths is attested by the large number
of fragments from the lost plays. It is instructive to see
that he was quoted in the Hellenistic period to the
exclusion of Aischylos and Sophokles. Wisdom and
state-craft were found in Homer, Hesiod, Pindar, and
Euripides<a id='r160' /><a href='#f160' class='c020'><sup>[160]</sup></a>. One is not surprised, therefore, to learn
that his tragedies were the only ones produced at certain
Dionysia<a id='r161' /><a href='#f161' class='c020'><sup>[161]</sup></a>. This was the period in which most of the
vase paintings in the following pages belong, and it is
only these numerous traditions of the unparalleled
popularity of this poet, east and west, north and south,
that makes it possible to appreciate his wide-spread
influence over art. The vases have to be studied in
this light, and only then does their importance as a
Euripidean commentary become sufficiently clear.</p>

<p class='c009'>A glance at the conditions in Magna Graecia is
necessary before leaving this topic. The theatre-going
propensities of the Tarentines has been mentioned above,
and one has now to ask himself who their favourite poet
was. There can be but one answer. Here, as in Africa,
Asia Minor, and Sicily, the public was sure to find the
greatest satisfaction in a Euripidean <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">répertoire</span></i>. The
travelling troops of actors performed in all the towns of
Apulia, Campania, and Lucania, and the tragic forms of
the myths were widely published. Euripides was, in
short, more than ever the people’s poet, and he became
later, with the rise of Latin tragedy, the poet of the
Republic. Roman tragedy was Greek in everything but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>the language. The 166 years between the death of
Euripides and the production of Livius Andronicus’ first
play in Rome were a seed-time for the works of the
Greek poet. The titles of Livius’ ten tragedies include
two from Euripides—the <cite>Andromeda</cite> and the <cite>Danaë</cite>—and
the father of Latin poetry was a native of Tarentum.
Ennius, born in Rudiae, which Strabo calls a <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πόλις
Ἑλληνίς</span><a id='r162' /><a href='#f162' class='c020'><sup>[162]</sup></a>, was educated at Tarentum, and became the
first national poet of the Romans. Among his twenty-two
plays the following are either translations of Euripides
or adaptations from him: <cite>Alexandrus</cite>, <cite>Andromacha</cite>,
<cite>Andromeda</cite>, <cite>Erechtheus</cite>, <cite>Medea</cite>, <cite>Medea exul</cite>, <cite>Melanippa</cite>,
<cite>Phoenix</cite>, <cite>Telephus</cite>, and perhaps <cite>Alcumena</cite>. Pacuvius,
a nephew of Ennius, and the third one of the Latin
tragedians, also followed Euripides more than Aischylos
or Sophokles. He was born in Brundusium 268 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>
and died in Tarentum 140 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span> These three poets who
come first in the history of Latin literature are peculiarly
indebted to Euripides and likewise have a special relation
to Magna Graecia and Tarentum. More than half of
the whole number of works produced by them would
appear to have been Euripidean. Whether it was the
rhetorical or pathetic element that appealed to the
Romans more strongly, the fact that Euripides was the
primary force in Latin tragedy is very important.</p>

<p class='c009'>In this attempt to indicate the wider influence of the
Attic drama upon the Latins I have been carried beyond
the time of the vase industry, but the Latin literature of
the third and second century <span class='fss'>B.C.</span> was the legitimate
product of the conditions that had prevailed in the
preceding period. The Greek literary and artistic genius
blossomed into an Italian flower and flourished in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>soil that had been fertilized by centuries of Hellenic
influences. It is to a small section of this wonderful life
in Magna Graecia that the present work is devoted.
The vase paintings that follow can best tell their own
story of the wide-spread Hellenization of Lower Italy in
the fourth century and of the place held by Euripides in
the onward march of Hellenism.</p>

<h3 class='c019'>§ 2. <span class='sc'>Andromache.</span></h3>

<p class='c018'>It does not appear that in the pre-Euripidean literature
Orestes played any part in the death of Neoptolemos.
Pindar at least did not know anything of the Menelaos-Orestes
conspiracy against the son of Achilles<a id='r163' /><a href='#f163' class='c020'><sup>[163]</sup></a> but
Menelaos’ relation to Sparta afforded a rare opportunity
for a political polemic. The latter could be painted as
a much more despicable character, as could also the
Lakedaimonians in general, provided Orestes were
involved in the unholy murder. The anti-Spartan
feeling in Athens was sufficient to guarantee a hearty
reception to any drama depicting the crookedness and
treachery of the Spartan character. Such a play was
certain to meet the demands of a campaign document.</p>

<p class='c009'>The <cite>Andromache</cite> has, however, little of the merit
which one can usually discover in Euripides; it was
classed even by the ancients among his second-rate
works<a id='r164' /><a href='#f164' class='c020'><sup>[164]</sup></a>. There is but one effective situation in the
whole tragedy, and that is the speech of the messenger,
vs. 1085–1165, which gives the account of Neoptolemos’
murder at Delphi. The beginning is remarkably simple
and unaffected, but when once the poet gets under way
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>the action increases rapidly in violence, becoming at
every step more and more intense until at last the
whole temple of Apollo resounds with the roar of the
unholy tumult. Orestes’ party is, of course, victorious
over the single-handed descendant of Peleus. This
manœuvring inside the temple is unique, and intensely
dramatic and picturesque. The pictorial importance of
the scene is attested by a painting on a large amphora
found in Ruvo<a id='r165' /><a href='#f165' class='c020'><sup>[165]</sup></a>.</p>

<p>Fig. 10.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>In the centre is the sanctuary of Apollo denoted by
two tripods, the laurel tree, the omphalos covered with
a netting, and the altar. To the latter, already dashed
with blood, Neoptolemos, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ΝΕΟΠΤΟΛΕΜΟΣ</span>, has fled.
He holds a drawn sword in his right hand and whirls his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>chlamys about his left. He wears a petasos and has
a sword-cut in his left side from which blood is oozing.
His face is turned towards the omphalos behind which
Orestes, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ΟΡΕΣΤΑΣ</span>, appears to be dodging. He has
a chlamys and a pilos; in his left hand the sheath
of a sword, the latter being in his right. On the
left, behind the altar, is another youth, nude except the
chlamys on the left arm. He holds a spear in the right
hand as though about to cast it at Neoptolemos. The
centre of the upper section is filled out with an Ionic
temple, the doors of which are open. On the left,
the half-figure of a woman, recognizable by the key
as the temple priestess (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κλῃδοῦχος</span>)<a id='r166' /><a href='#f166' class='c020'><sup>[166]</sup></a>, appears in great
alarm. Apollo, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ΑΠΟΛΛΩΝ</span>, with his bow, occupies
a seat on the right of the temple<a id='r167' /><a href='#f167' class='c020'><sup>[167]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c009'>In order to understand the painting it is necessary to
bear in mind what preceded the speech of the messenger.
Andromache, the wife of Hektor, had fallen to the lot
of Neoptolemos on the division of the Trojan spoils and
had been taken by him to Phthia. As his captive she
had raised him a son, Molossos, while his lawful wife
Hermione, daughter of Menelaos and cousin of Orestes,
continued barren. Hermione, being suspicious that it
was through some drugs of Andromache that she had
been rendered thus unhappy, determined upon the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>latter’s death, and while Neoptolemos was absent at
Delphi to atone for certain family wrongs the desperate
Hermione proceeded to carry out her resolve to destroy
both the mother and the young Molossos. This spiteful
work of the injured wife occupies the first part of the
tragedy. The two are finally saved by the intervention
of the aged Peleus, and Hermione thereupon resolves to
kill herself. At this point, Orestes, who is on his way
to consult the oracle at Dodona, enters. On learning of
the insults and injuries that had been heaped upon
Hermione, once promised him for a bride, he at once
undertakes to relieve her of any reason for dreading the
return of Neoptolemos and the attendant disclosure of
her wicked plans.</p>

<p class='c009'>He leaves accordingly for Delphi. The messenger
comes in after a song by the chorus and relates what has
taken place. Orestes had gone round putting the
Delphians on their guard against this Neoptolemos
whose plan was to sack the temple. Credence was at
once given to the fabrication, and the inhabitants determined
upon a bold step. When Neoptolemos was at
the altar addressing the god, the band of armed
Delphians who were lying in wait for him behind the
sacred laurel tree sprang out and fell upon him.</p>

<p class='c009'>This furnishes the setting for our painting, and we
may turn for a little to a closer examination of the
account given by the poet. It will be noticed that the
artist, while in some respects keeping close to the latter,
has in the main done his work rather independently.
Common to both are the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">δάφνη</span> (v. 1115) and the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">βωμός</span>
(vs. 1123 and 1138). The attacking party in the
painting includes Orestes, thus emphasizing the point
which Euripides really had in mind. In this particular
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>the artist has gone ahead of the poet. It appears,
indeed, as though Orestes had just made the slash in
Neoptolemos’ side. The moment represented is, therefore,
that when the fight was on. The Delphians appear
to have but one representative, who is certainly creating
far less annoyance for Neoptolemos than does the
company in Euripides, where they hurl rocks and fill
the air with dust and din. The setting of the scene
in the painting is magnificent. Everything points to
the great shrine; both the exterior and interior of the
temple are visible. As for the Ionic order it should be
remembered that this has nought to do with the historic
facts in the case. An examination of the buildings on
the vases of Lower Italy reveals a decided preference on
the part of the artists for this order of architecture<a id='r168' /><a href='#f168' class='c020'><sup>[168]</sup></a>.
The painting is an excellent example of the influence of
the poet over the artist. This is, however, no mere
illustration, a fact to be remembered in dealing with all
the paintings of this class; the spirit and not the letter
is what one can trace most readily in works of art based
upon the tragedians. The agreement between the literary
source and the picture is more apparent here than
in most instances, and this is largely due to the fact
that the <cite>Andromache</cite> is particularly Euripidean. This
turn does not occur in any other author. A parallel
case will be observed in the chapter dealing with <em>Iphigeneia
among the Taurians</em>. It is this alteration and
extension of old myths which characterizes Euripides’
work. These new features were popular and attracted the
public, and here one gets the key to the unparalleled
influence which this poet exercised upon artists.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>
  <h3 class='c019'>§ 3. <span class='sc'>Bakchai.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c018'>Euripides’ <cite>Bakchai</cite> is our chief authority concerning
the fate of Pentheus<a id='r169' /><a href='#f169' class='c020'><sup>[169]</sup></a>, yet this writer did not by any
means establish the details of the story. This was done
long before Thespis may have assayed to dramatize the
tragic episode<a id='r170' /><a href='#f170' class='c020'><sup>[170]</sup></a> and before Aischylos wrote his <cite>Pentheus</cite><a id='r171' /><a href='#f171' class='c020'><sup>[171]</sup></a>.
It is not probable that Euripides materially altered the
accepted form of the myth, and there may be in his
play a mixture of the traditional and Aischylean versions.
Pentheus’ death, like the madness of the Thracian king
Lykurgos, was inseparably connected with the advent
of the Dionysiac worship. The series of victories won
by the orgiastic god from the wild North was not bloodless;
his coming was attended with opposition. In
the end, however, his foes were annihilated or ruined,
and the new joy brought in by the foreign god captivated
a nation and made it his devout worshipper.
Euripides could say little or nothing new touching the
triumph of Dionysos over the king of Thebes, yet this
tragedy, one of the most brilliant pieces of Greek
literature, paints in glorious colours the history of the
victory.</p>

<p class='c009'>The events, as told by Euripides, are briefly as
follows. Dionysos has arrived in Thebes from Lydia
and the East, where he had already established his
choirs of Bacchanals. Thebes was the first city to
which he came, and here, where he least expected
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>opposition, scepticism met him. The sisters of his
mother Semele circulated the report that he was no
god but an impostor. He forthwith drove the Kadmeian
women maddened from their homes to wander in the
mountains attired in the Dionysiac dress; the Bacchic
craze spread further, and seized even the seer Teiresias
and Kadmos, who with thyrsoi and fawn-skins joined the
orgies. Pentheus, on hearing of these strange doings,
appears and chides them both, and threatens to hunt
the women from the mountains and punish the stranger
who has made his family drunk with frenzy. At v. 434
Dionysos, bewitchingly beautiful, is led a prisoner before
Pentheus, who orders him to be bound and cast into the
royal stable. Soon afterward the walls are heard to crash
in and flames burst forth in every direction (v. 593 ff.).
The god, to be sure, is safe, and Pentheus is mocked
and wild with anger, while the former bids him be quiet
and subdue his anger. At this point a messenger
arrives to recount the strange sights that had met his
eyes on the mountains. Three bands of women, led by
Autonoë, Agave, and Ino, had rushed upon his herd of
cattle and torn them limb from limb, and afterward they
washed the blood from their hands in a fountain made
to flow by the god. In the face of these wonders he
urges Pentheus to honour the latter, but the king will
not brook this Bacchic insolence and threatens to sacrifice
a hekatomb of women on Kithairon rather than propitiate
the unwelcome visitor. Dionysos advises him
not to kick against the pricks (v. 795); in a moment
Pentheus’ attitude is seen to change; the secret power
of the god is working on him; he will see the strange
actions himself, and would rather forfeit a thousand-weight
in gold than forgo the opportunity (v. 812).
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>The linen chiton is at once provided, and Dionysos,
who is to lead the way, directs the arrangement of the
dress so that Pentheus shall not be mistaken for a man.
After some scruples as to the figure he may make
before his citizens he is anxious to be off. Once in
the mountains giddiness comes upon him. He sees two
suns, and a double Thebes, and twice seven gates; he
declares that the god himself has taken on a bull’s
form with horns (v. 918 ff.). Immediately thereafter he
obtains the first glimpse of the women. There are Ino
and his mother Agave. Then he worries lest he may
not hold his thyrsos correctly. This shows his sad
predicament too plainly. Dionysos has done his work;
his vengeance on the recalcitrant Pentheus is at hand.
At first the latter feels himself able to overturn the
whole mountain and asks the advice of the god as to
the best means of annihilating the troop. When violence
is not recommended he suggests that he had best hide
in a pine-tree to view the sight (v. 954). Nothing further
is ever heard from the king’s own lips except in his
death-cry reported by the messenger who had accompanied
him. When they had reached the band in the
glen, shadowed by pines (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πεύκη</span>, v. 1052), the thicket
was so dense that Pentheus requested that he might be
allowed to ascend the bank or climb a tree (v. 1061) in
order to command the field. Dionysos bent a tree to the
ground, placed the king upon the boughs and allowed
it to rise again, and, turning to his devotees, pointed to
their prey. Stones and darts are directed at Pentheus,
and finally the tree is pulled up by main force and he
falls an easy victim to the maddened women. Agave,
heeding none of his cries, tears out a shoulder; Ino,
Autonoë, and the rest help in dismembering the king.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>His mother fixed his head upon a thyrsos and led the
troop on a wild dance over Kithairon, finally coming
to the palace. Gradually freed from the insanity, she
realized the enormity of her crime. Dionysos’ godhead
was, however, established, and the house of Kadmos
remained a terrible witness of his power. These are
the harrowing details of the murder, and one cannot
wonder that there are numerous vase paintings based
on the tragedy.</p>

<p class='c009'>There is a long list of vases that can for the most part
be passed over with a mere reference. They are all, with
perhaps one exception, later than 500 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span> This means
that the impetus for the tragedy in art was given largely
by the tragic drama. The oldest painting is older than
the <cite>Pentheus</cite> of Aischylos and cannot, therefore, be connected
with his play. There may have been an earlier
dramatization, such as that recorded of Thespis, which
figured in this monument<a id='r172' /><a href='#f172' class='c020'><sup>[172]</sup></a>. All the remaining paintings
belong to the latter part of the fifth century <span class='fss'>B.C.</span> and
the fourth century <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>, and are, with one exception,
of too general a character to be used as evidence for
one of the tragedies<a id='r173' /><a href='#f173' class='c020'><sup>[173]</sup></a>. On the Munich hydria it seems
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>to me there are clear traces of the <cite>Bakchai</cite>, and this
widely-known work is given here in fig. 11<a id='r174' /><a href='#f174' class='c020'><sup>[174]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>Fig. 11.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Pentheus, wearing chlamys, pilos, and boots, crouches,
with a drawn sword in his right hand, in a thicket
denoted by two trees. A maenad who appears to have
just discovered him rushes into the hiding-place with
a torch in her right hand<a id='r175' /><a href='#f175' class='c020'><sup>[175]</sup></a>; she is dressed in a plain,
Doric peplos. Another maenad, similarly dressed but
having a fawn-skin over the left hand and a sword in
the right, does not seem to have sighted Pentheus.
A third, dressed like the first one, holding a tympanon
in the left hand and a thyrsos in the right, approaches
wholly unconcerned with the discovery of her companions.
On the right is another group of three maenads
all dressed alike and all in rapid motion. The first
holds in either hand the quarters of a kid or roe. The
second shoulders the thyrsos with her left hand and
makes an ecstatic gesture with her right. The third
one, in even more violent motion, swings her veil about
her and rushes on towards the left.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>It should be noted, to begin with, that the vase is
a Lower Italy fabric of the fourth century <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>, and that
there is therefore no chronological difficulty in placing it
under the influence of the <cite>Bakchai</cite>. The troop of maenads
is arranged symmetrically, an equal number being on
each side of the central scene, and this suggests the
chorus in the play. The striking feature is the introduction
of the landscape; there is no doubt as to
where the catastrophe occurs. The artist did not allow
himself the licence of placing Pentheus in the tree, for
this had been too grotesque a sight for the fourth-century
painter. The frequent references to the thicket<a id='r176' /><a href='#f176' class='c020'><sup>[176]</sup></a> and
the protection it was or the inconvenience it caused,
is happily brought out in the picture, but the poet has
not been followed in details. Pentheus does not appear
with the thyrsos, talaric chiton, and dishevelled hair, for
the simple reason that he would have been indistinguishable
from the maenads. As he appears in the painting
the contrast is striking and the eye at once grasps
the situation. The torch held by the foremost maenad
lights the way to the retreat of Pentheus, suggesting the
words—</p>

<p class='c022'>In conclusion, reference should be made again to the
newly discovered wall painting in Pompeii. It is so
remarkably preserved and so thoroughly in the spirit
of Euripides that there can be little doubt as to the
influence of the <cite>Bakchai</cite><a id='r177' /><a href='#f177' class='c020'><sup>[177]</sup></a>. The only Pentheus painting
recorded in classical literature was that in the Dionysos
temple in Athens, which may also have been inspired
by Euripides<a id='r178' /><a href='#f178' class='c020'><sup>[178]</sup></a>. Is the Pompeian painting an echo of
the celebrated one in Athens?</p>

<h3 class='c019'>§ 4. <span class='sc'>Hekabe.</span></h3>

<p class='c018'>The <cite>Hekabe</cite> is one of those plays which, like the
<cite>Andromache</cite>, embraces a series of events loosely associated.
There are in fact two distinct parts to this
tragedy, having no other connexion than one would
observe between two separate works where the same
heroine appeared. Two heavy blows which the Fates
dealt Hekabe after the fall of Troy constitute the subject
of the action.</p>

<p class='c009'>The first of these new calamities was the death of
Polyxena. The Greeks are encamped on the Chersonesos
side of the Hellespont. Among the captives
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>are the former queen of Troy and her daughter.
Achilles, who is among the shades, demands of the
Greeks that Polyxena be sacrificed to him. The request
cannot be ignored, and Odysseus and others are commissioned
to secure her from her mother. The parting
scene between Hekabe and the daughter is heartrending,
but the courage and self-control exhibited by the latter
are remarkable. Talthybios, the faithful herald of
Agamemnon, afterwards reports to Hekabe the details of
the sacrifice, and this description of the fair and innocent
Polyxena is one of the gems of Greek literature. The
lines in particular which describe her actions immediately
before the fatal moment are famous for their beauty.</p>

<p class='c009'>Although the offering of Polyxena was known in Greek
art and letters before Euripides’ time<a id='r179' /><a href='#f179' class='c020'><sup>[179]</sup></a>, the subject must
have been far more popular after the production of
this tragedy. It appears to me a mere accident that no
vase painting representing the scene has so far come to
light. There is, however, on a so-called ‘Megarian

third century <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>, which doubtless owes its existence
to Euripides<a id='r180' /><a href='#f180' class='c020'><sup>[180]</sup></a>. It has seemed to me desirable to include
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>this here, even though it carries us beyond the limits
prescribed to the present work. The cup, found in
Thebes, is in the Berlin Antiquarium<a id='r181' /><a href='#f181' class='c020'><sup>[181]</sup></a>. The middle of
the composition represents the tumulus of Achilles, above
which is raised a stele with akroteria and a fillet. On
the left, Polyxena, with exposed bosom and flowing
hair, kneels with extended arms. Approaching her is
Neoptolemos wearing a chlamys and holding his sword
ready for the fatal stroke; behind the latter is a figure
in a short undergarment, mantle and pilos. The cap
distinguishes the person as Odysseus. Agamemnon sits
with back to the beholder upon the extreme left, and
lifts his left hand (not his right hand as Robert says),
evidently astonished at the remarkable composure of
the victim. On the right of the tomb are three warriors,
who are more or less closely connected with the others.
The first one appears to raise his hand in wonder at the
fortitude of Polyxena; the second, who does not seem
to be armed, has the appearance of one weeping; the
third is apparently little interested in the tragedy. It
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>is not necessary to name these three persons, evidently
representatives of the Achaeans. The first one may
perhaps be Talthybios, since he says he was present
(v. 524). The dolphins upon the vase are meant no
doubt to characterize the sea-shore where the sacrifice
took place.</p>

<p class='c022'>and had dismissed Talthybios to Hekabe (v. 504).</p>

<p class='c009'>The second part of the play begins with v. 658, where
the servant of Hekabe enters with the body of the latter’s
young son Polydoros. Priam had intrusted the boy to
Polymestor, king of Thrace, when the Greeks attacked
Ilion. A considerable sum of gold accompanied the
child to ensure his maintenance if the city should be
captured. As long as the Trojans held out, Polymestor
was true to his charge, but no sooner had the news of
the downfall of Priam’s house reached the ears of the
good Thracian than he put the child to death for
the money and cast his body out unburied. This is
related in the prologue by the ghost of Polydoros, who
also prophesies the death of Polyxena on that day.
His body was accordingly discovered by the attendant,
who happened upon it by mere chance, and immediately
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>after receiving the terrible message from Talthybios,
Hekabe was made to bow beneath another sorrow. She
at once summons her courage and determines to have
revenge upon the unrighteous Polymestor. She first
relates to Agamemnon the story of the boy’s death, and
the king, deeply incensed at the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀξενία</span> of the Thracian,
agrees to her plan for avenging herself on the latter.
She sends for Polymestor under the pretence of disclosing
to him some weighty matter. He comes, and at her
request dismisses his bodyguard, not mistrusting in the
least that his crime had been discovered. To questions
as to the welfare of Polydoros and the safety of the gold
he replies that all is well and that the child would gladly
have come to visit his mother. Hekabe then proceeds
to tell him of some treasures which she wishes to commit
to his keeping. These are in the tent, and he shall go
inside and examine them for himself. ‘No Achaean is
within; we are quite alone,’ she says, and with this
assurance Polymestor leaves the light of day for ever.
Once inside, his cries of agony soon announce that
Hekabe has done her work with swift and certain
hand.</p>

<p class='c009'>The scene representing the reappearance of the blinded
Polymestor has been recognized on a Lucanian vase<a id='r182' /><a href='#f182' class='c020'><sup>[182]</sup></a>.
In the middle stands the helpless king, his arms extended
in a distressed manner. He is dressed in a short,
embroidered chiton and a mantle, and wears a tall
head-gear that indicates his barbarian nationality. Agamemnon
is on the left, with sceptre and himation; he
appears to be addressing the former. Following is a
doryphoros. On the right are Hekabe and an attendant,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>both dressed in chiton and mantle. The latter places
her arm over Hekabe’s shoulder and seems to be comforting
her, as she shrinks away from the figure in the
centre. The cane is suggestive of the queen’s age and
of the wandering life upon which she is entering. A sword
rests upon the ground, pointing probably to the weapon
which was used to blind Polymestor. It is not necessary
to cite any particular verses from Euripides which the
artist may have had in mind. He simply told the story
as it recurred to him. Especially suggestive of the
king’s staggering step are the verses beginning</p>

  <h3 class='c019'>§ 5. <span class='sc'>Hippolytos.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c018'>In the <cite>Phaidra</cite> of Sophokles and the first <cite>Hippolytos</cite>
of Euripides it was Phaidra herself who acknowledged to
Hippolytos her love for him. The votary of Artemis,
at once enraged at this effrontery, cast her aside. She
then defamed the youth to Theseus, who, believing her
statement, prayed to Poseidon to destroy his son. The
god accordingly sent a sea-monster to frighten the
horses of Hippolytos, and the latter was soon dragged to
his death. On receiving the news of this, Phaidra hung
herself<a id='r183' /><a href='#f183' class='c020'><sup>[183]</sup></a>. Sophokles’ play does not appear to have ever
made any impression upon the world and must have been
soon forgotten, and Euripides’ tragedy met with great
disapproval. Such a Phaidra was more than the Greeks
would tolerate. The poet grasped the situation and
wrote another <cite>Hippolytos</cite>, which set him right with his
public. It was no longer Phaidra in and of herself who
became the instrument of the youth’s death; Aphrodite,
angered at Hippolytos’ serving Artemis instead of herself,
starts the gentle flame within Phaidra’s bosom and
visits her with a love-sickness that drives the unfortunate
woman into a confession of her illness to her attendant.
On the latter’s placing the matter before Hippolytos, all
to no avail, Phaidra takes her own life, not forgetting, however,
to leave behind a letter containing delicate charges
against her step-son. Theseus returns, finds his wife
a corpse, and reads the letter. The curse and death of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>his son follow, as in the earlier <cite>Hippolytos</cite>. This ruin was
brought on him not so much by Phaidra as by Aphrodite.</p>

<p class='c009'>The tragedy was counted among the best of Euripides’,
and has always retained its popularity. The
subject was dramatized again in Greek<a id='r184' /><a href='#f184' class='c020'><sup>[184]</sup></a>, and there is
extant the Latin version of Seneca<a id='r185' /><a href='#f185' class='c020'><sup>[185]</sup></a>. The theme was one
which was sure to appeal to modern authors, and among
the French alone one hears of no less than seven tragedies
on the love of Phaidra, written between the years 1573
and 1786. Four of these, the most famous of which is
Racine’s <cite>Phèdre</cite>, belong to the seventeenth century.
They are, however, more directly indebted to Seneca
and Ovid<a id='r186' /><a href='#f186' class='c020'><sup>[186]</sup></a> than to Euripides. Mention should be made
also of the two operas by Pellegrin, 1733, and Lemoine,
1786. But after all has been said on versions of the story
either in classical or modern times, one turns to the
masterpiece of Euripides as the great work. According
to the author of the Hypothesis, the play is among the
best of this poet and was given the first prize. In
reflecting that Hippolytos has stood forth since March,
428 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>, as the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">beau idéal</span></i> of innocent, unsullied, young
manhood, one is inclined to credit the judges with
possessing good sense.</p>

<p class='c009'>There was hardly a more attractive legend than this
which the artists might have been tempted to make
their own, yet one discovers a surprising dearth of Greek
monuments that can be referred to the myth. From
these I select two vase paintings that appear to be based
upon Euripides.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>Fig. 14 represents a painting on a krater in the British
Museum<a id='r187' /><a href='#f187' class='c020'><sup>[187]</sup></a>. The upper section alone concerns us here, and
this shows the interior of a gynaikonitis with <em>kline</em>. On
the left is a group of two females. One sits on a stool
to the right, wears chiton and veil, diadem, bracelets, and
necklace, and leans forward, with head dropped to one
side, clasping her right knee thrown over the other.
Her left foot rests on a foot-stool. Behind her a white-haired
servant in the usual costume holds her right hand
to her chin, and with troubled air gestures with the left
hand as she speaks to her mistress. A large Eros with
immense wings flies down towards the latter with a taenia
in his hands. There are, further, two other groups of
two each. The one before the <em>kline</em> is two females again.
An attendant, distinguished by her hood, who holds
a fan in her right hand, talks and gestures earnestly
before the other, who wears the simple Doric peplos,
ungirdled, and stands with her back to the <em>kline</em> in
a disturbed and troubled sort of mood. The remaining
group of two, a pedagogue in the customary dress and
a female figure similar to the one on the extreme left,
is also concerned over some important matter which the
pedagogue is telling. Certain articles hang on the wall.</p>

<p class='c009'>The picture has been interpreted as representing
Phaidra in the presence of the chorus, and depending
upon <cite>Hippolytos</cite> vs. 267 ff. The right-hand group would
then be very loosely connected with the rest. In so far
as the love-sickness of Phaidra is concerned this appears
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>to me a correct interpretation, but that the chorus is in
any way represented by the other figures is entirely out
of the question. The whole affair is supposed to be in
Phaidra’s apartments, to which at no time the Troizenian
women had access. What would they be doing by the
<em>kline</em><a id='r188' /><a href='#f188' class='c020'><sup>[188]</sup></a>? The pedagogue is added on one side, as though
to indicate how the news is spreading among the
domestics<a id='r189' /><a href='#f189' class='c020'><sup>[189]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c009'>But let me turn for a moment to another class of
monuments that help to a better understanding of the
scene. There are no less than seventeen reliefs on
the long side of Roman sarcophagi which are practically
intact and furnish from two to three scenes of the
tragedy. Less frequently the ends contain one or two
other groups supplementing the front side<a id='r190' /><a href='#f190' class='c020'><sup>[190]</sup></a>. There are
four moments that are distinctly traceable. (1) The
love-sick Phaidra sits on a chair in her apartments surrounded
by the old nurse and other servants, who attempt
to comfort her. She wears a veil as on the vase painting,
and on two reliefs one of the attendants is removing
this<a id='r191' /><a href='#f191' class='c020'><sup>[191]</sup></a>. The diadem is also distinguishable. (2) The
nurse makes her declaration to Hippolytos, who turns
away from her. (3) Hippolytos with his followers is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>about to start upon, or is already engaged in, the hunt.
(4) The horses run away and bring him to his death.
All four scenes occur on the famous sarcophagus in
Girgenti<a id='r192' /><a href='#f192' class='c020'><sup>[192]</sup></a>, and on another in St. Petersburg<a id='r193' /><a href='#f193' class='c020'><sup>[193]</sup></a>. It will
be observed that in three of the four groups Hippolytos
himself is present, and one naturally looks for him in
scenes taken from the tragedy where he is the main
figure. The earliest scene in Euripides which develops
the hopeless state of affairs with Phaidra is, however, of
prime importance next to the death of Hippolytos.</p>

<p class='c009'>But a brief comparison of the left-hand group of our
painting and the Phaidra scene on these reliefs is
necessary, in order to reveal a striking resemblance in
the compositions. The one difference rests in the size
of the groups; the painter has confined himself to fewer
figures. This fact, however, is of little importance.
A closer examination of the two discloses much that
points to a common source. On nearly all the reliefs
Phaidra’s chair has, as in the painting, no back or arms;
Eros, who flies towards Phaidra in fig. 14, invariably stands
beside her on the sarcophagi, looking up into her sad
face, or, what is still worse, aims an arrow at her<a id='r194' /><a href='#f194' class='c020'><sup>[194]</sup></a>. The
queen wears in all cases the veil, and often on the reliefs the
diadem likewise<a id='r195' /><a href='#f195' class='c020'><sup>[195]</sup></a>. The nurse never fails in her ministry.</p>

<p class='c009'>It is time now to look more closely at the tragedy.
After the prologue by Aphrodite, Hippolytos and his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>followers enter and pay their homage to Artemis. The
hero lays a wreath upon her statue, which adorned one
side of the entrance to Pittheus’ palace. The attendants
are ordered inside and he then withdraws. His servant
remains long enough to address a prayer to Aphrodite’s
image on the other side of the stage. Following is the
parodos in which the chorus relates what had been
learned concerning the illness of Phaidra. Among other
things they hear that she sits</p>

<div class='lg-container-l c021'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">... λεπτὰ δὲ φάρη</span></div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c022'>This, it will be observed, corresponds to her position in
the painting and in the reliefs. It is just this time of
abstinence and mourning, spent in the palace surrounded
by the faithful old nurse and other servants, which
suggested the scene on the reliefs and on the vase. The
visitations of Eros serve well to bring into objectivity
the real cause of Phaidra’s illness, and to render the poet
more plain. To be sure this all took place in her
apartments, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐντὸς οἴκων</span> (v. 132), and could therefore be
worked out according to the artist’s fancy. A long and
animated scene ensues, in which Phaidra utters strange
expressions that betray the sadness of her condition.
The trophos finally coaxes the secret from her, and the
chorus dips in from time to time as a sort of second to
the nurse. The interview which the latter has with
Hippolytos, vs. 601–668, is overheard by Phaidra. Her
unrequited love bears her down and she leaves the stage
determined to die (v. 731), and in a few moments is
announced as dead<a id='r196' /><a href='#f196' class='c020'><sup>[196]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>The scenes on the sarcophagi representing Hippolytos’
hunt, the counterpart of Phaidra’s illness, and the
trophos’ proposal<a id='r197' /><a href='#f197' class='c020'><sup>[197]</sup></a> to the hero do not appear on vases.</p>

<p class='c009'>Hippolytos’ ride to death, the terrible <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">finale</span></i> of the
tragedy, appears on an Apulian krater also in the British
Museum<a id='r198' /><a href='#f198' class='c020'><sup>[198]</sup></a>. The painting falls into an upper and lower
section. In the latter, Hippolytos dashes along in his
chariot; the four horses are not in any apparent disorder
although the next moment must be fatal, for just before
them the sea-monster rises into view, and a Fury with
a flaming torch and serpents wound about her arms runs
into their course. A pedagogue hurries along from the
rear, extending his left hand, warning Hippolytos of his
danger. The scene is viewed by five divinities. Their
positions are the stereotyped ones of the Apulian vases,
and their connexion with the tragedy before them need
not be intimate<a id='r199' /><a href='#f199' class='c020'><sup>[199]</sup></a>. Athena in the middle, a great favourite
in these groups, leans on her shield and carries a lance
and in her right hand the helmet. Apollo, distinguished
by bow, laurel bough, and wreath in the hair, sits on her
right, facing Pan who stands half reversed to the beholder
with the syrinx in the right hand, and resting his left
elbow on a rock. On Athena’s left sits Aphrodite,
attended by a large Eros, who extends a kylix to
Poseidon sitting on the right, holding the trident.
There is certainly ample reason for the presence of the
last two gods at the death of Hippolytos; they are, in
fact, very instrumental in bringing about the catastrophe.
I am not able to assign any satisfactory reason for the
appearance of Athena, Apollo, and Pan. Mere speculation
concerning the choice of these deities cannot be of
much value. Artemis is surely indispensable in a group
of gods concerned with Hippolytos’ death. Any one
who knows these groups on the vases of Lower Italy is
aware that Athena is a great favourite and often appears,
as here, merely because she was so admired. Perhaps
Apollo is intended to represent Artemis, but it is not
likely that the artist thought so far<a id='r200' /><a href='#f200' class='c020'><sup>[200]</sup></a>.</p>

<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>of Hippolytos are represented only by the
pedagogue. The time is that just preceding the breaking
away of the horses described by the messenger, vs. 1218 ff.
The Fury, a gratuitous addition of the artist, serves to
intensify the violence of the death awaiting Hippolytos.</p>

<p class='c009'>The deplorable end of the hero has never failed to
awaken one’s sympathy. The innocent youth dragged
to his death through the workings of a hasty and unjust
curse presents one of the most pathetic pictures in Greek
literature. It is well depicted by Philostratos in the
<cite>Imagines</cite><a id='r203' /><a href='#f203' class='c020'><sup>[203]</sup></a>. ‘You see,’ he says, ‘how the horses no
longer obey the reins but rush madly along the plain,
covered with foam. This one makes for the wild beast,
the second rebounds, another rushes for the sea, and the
fourth glances fearfully at the ground.’ The breaking
and crashing of the chariot are pointed out. Then the
companions gallop up and try to manage the horses.
The hills near by, sentinels of the disaster, in the form
of women, tear their cheeks for grief; the meadows, in
the form of boys, allow their flowers to wilt and the
nymphs from the springs rend their hair, while water
spouts from their breasts. Hippolytos’ limbs are torn
and shattered, and his eyes are gouged from their sockets.
Pliny tells of a painting by Antiphilus of Alexandria
which represented <cite><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hippolytus tauro emisso expavescens</span></cite><a id='r204' /><a href='#f204' class='c020'><sup>[204]</sup></a>,
but nothing further is known of Antiphilus or when he
lived. The sarcophagi reliefs representing the catastrophe
are numerous, compared with those showing any other

<h3 class='c019'>§ 6. <span class='sc'>Iphigeneia at Aulis.</span></h3>

<p class='c018'>The story of Iphigeneia’s sacrifice appears to have
been told first in the <cite>Kypria</cite>, and yet only occasional
references are made to it by writers before the fifth
century. It was the drama that infused new life into the
myth and launched it as one of the most popular ones in
the Trojan Cycle. Each of the three great tragedians
tried his hand at the catastrophe in Aulis. Euripides’
work, the only one surviving, is at least two generations
younger than the play of Aischylos, so that the wide
popularity of the tragedy in this period is well attested.
Among the Roman poets we know that Ennius, at least,
wrote a version of the tragedy. Although it is known
that this poet had a special predilection for Euripides,
and for the most part translated or adapted the latter’s
plays, attempts have been made to show that in his
<cite>Iphigenia</cite> Ennius was largely indebted to Sophokles<a id='r208' /><a href='#f208' class='c020'><sup>[208]</sup></a>.
The few fragments remaining from these three <cite>Iphigeneias</cite>
are, however, inconsiderable, and a clear notion of their
relation to each other cannot be reached. The extant
work of Euripides is accordingly of great value to us.</p>

<p class='c009'>In art, likewise, this subject was rarely treated.
I know of no Iphigeneia monument earlier than the fifth
century. There is a reference in the <cite>Agamemnon</cite> to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>sacrifice as though Aischylos may have seen the scene
represented in a painting<a id='r209' /><a href='#f209' class='c020'><sup>[209]</sup></a>, and granted that the poet
really had such a work in mind this becomes the earliest
date for Iphigeneia in art. The earliest monument of
which we possess any authentic record is the famous
painting of Timanthes, who was a contemporary of
Zeuxis and Parrhasios<a id='r210' /><a href='#f210' class='c020'><sup>[210]</sup></a>. This date, however, does not
carry one beyond the last years of the fifth century <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>—an
altogether late date for an art representation of
a myth, which, from Aischylos’ time at least, was widely
known. We have reason to believe that Timanthes’
work was suggested by Euripides’ tragedy. The latter
was first produced in Athens after the poet’s death, not
earlier than 405 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>, and this requires that the painting
be placed near the end of the century, which many are
unwilling to admit; it is, however, more a matter of
opinion than proof. Traces of this celebrated picture
are very probably at hand in the well-known Pompeian
wall painting<a id='r211' /><a href='#f211' class='c020'><sup>[211]</sup></a>, and the Uffizi altar<a id='r212' /><a href='#f212' class='c020'><sup>[212]</sup></a>. The composition
of the latter has much in common with such fifth-century
products as the Orpheus and Peliades reliefs<a id='r213' /><a href='#f213' class='c020'><sup>[213]</sup></a>. The
Etruscan urns on the other hand furnish a wealth of
reliefs representing the sacrifice, rarely surpassed in
this class of monuments. Numbers have come to light
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>in the neighbourhood of Perugia especially<a id='r214' /><a href='#f214' class='c020'><sup>[214]</sup></a>. Two
groups are easily distinguishable, (1) Iphigeneia, as
a little girl, is held over the altar by Odysseus, while
Agamemnon goes through the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀπαρχαί</span>. (2) The first
group is extended by (<em>a</em>) Klytaimestra on the side of
Agamemnon, and (<em>b</em>) Achilles on the side of Odysseus,
each begging for mercy and the life of Iphigeneia. This
is all non-Euripidean, and Schlie has attempted to point
out that the reliefs owe their origin to Ennius’ play
which combined Sophoklean and Euripidean elements<a id='r215' /><a href='#f215' class='c020'><sup>[215]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c009'>There is no vase painting which can be claimed for
this scene in its Euripidean character, but the whole play
is the basis of a relief on a ‘Megarian’ cup, and the
illustration is so valuable for the proper appreciation
of the tragedy that I do not hesitate to include this little
monument. The cup furnishes inscriptional evidence
not only for the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">dramatis personae</span></i> but for the literary
source as well, and is, therefore, a <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">unicum</span></i> among the
monuments that are based upon Euripides. The cut
given in fig. 16 is of the vase in Berlin<a id='r216' /><a href='#f216' class='c020'><sup>[216]</sup></a>. It should
be observed, however, that there are two other copies
of this same work, and that they tell exactly the same
story from the <cite>Iphigeneia</cite><a id='r217' /><a href='#f217' class='c020'><sup>[217]</sup></a>. A word is necessary in
order to prepare us for the first scene given. Agamemnon
had sent a message to Argos summoning Iphigeneia,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>and, in spite of his attempt to countermand this by
a secret letter to Klytaimestra, he was forced to face
the results of his earlier resolve. His daughter came,
and accompanying her were her mother and her young
brother Orestes. The nuptials were to be celebrated
with the son of Peleus, and the Argive party in gayest,
happiest mood halted before the tent of Agamemnon.
The Chalkian women, who through curiosity had crossed
the Euripos to see the gathered hosts of the Greeks,
are ready at hand to assist Iphigeneia in alighting from
the chariot. The lad Orestes, who appears to have
gone to sleep during the journey, is awakened and lifted
down by one of the kindly strangers. With her mother’s
permission, Iphigeneia hastens inside to meet her father<a id='r218' /><a href='#f218' class='c020'><sup>[218]</sup></a>—she,
innocently happy over the arrival of her wedding
day—he, overcome with grief at her impending death,
and smitten with remorse at the enormity of his crime.</p>

<p class='c022'>Such is the situation described by the poet, and surely
the artist has succeeded to a considerable degree in
grasping the meaning of the scene. Klytaimestra,
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ΚΛΥΤΑΙΜΗΣΤΡΑ</span><a id='r219' /><a href='#f219' class='c020'><sup>[219]</sup></a>, appears on the left with Orestes,
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ΟΡΕΣΤΗΣ</span>, and would seem to have had the boy
in charge after he was helped from the chariot (vs. 621 f.).
Following is the inscription, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ΕΥΡ[ΙΠΙΔΟΥ] ΙΦΙΓΕΝΕΙΑΣ</span>.
The genitive case in the last word may depend upon
some such word as <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τύποι</span>. To avoid a possible misunderstanding
of the scenes, even with the characters
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>named each time, the artist considered it advisable
to add the literary source. This is the <cite>Iphigeneia of
Euripides</cite> and not of any other poet.</p>

<p class='c009'>After Iphigeneia leaves her father he endeavours to persuade
Klytaimestra to return to Argos and leave the final
arrangements for the nuptials in his charge. Naturally
enough she refuses, and retires to appear at v. 819, where
she meets Achilles and enthusiastically brings up the
subject of the marriage. Achilles, amazed at the disclosure,
assures the queen that he has neither wooed
Iphigeneia nor heard aught from the Atreidai concerning
any such an alliance. This scene is represented in the
next group. Achilles, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ΑΧΙΛΛΕΥΣ</span>, bends toward Klytaimestra
and gestures emphatically. The latter holds her
hand to her chin and is evidently dumbfounded by
the declarations. The last words exchanged before the
two separate are suggestive—</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Immediately after these words the faithful old servant
of Agamemnon comes out and relates to Klytaimestra
that Iphigeneia is to be slain by her father; he goes
further and tells the cause of it all, and how he had
failed to get away to Argos with the letter. This
meeting of the servant, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ΠΡΕΣΣΒΥΣ</span>, and the queen,
is dramatically told in the third group. The former
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>wears the costume of a pedagogue, with peculiar-looking
boots. The latter has laid aside the veil which she
wears in all the other scenes.</p>

<p class='c009'>The following groups on the relief reverse the order
of the text, so it is best to consider first that on the
extreme left. Agamemnon, Klytaimestra, and Iphigeneia
are all named. The young Orestes pulls at his
father’s chiton; the latter has a mantle over his head, and
shields his face with his left hand. The mother has turned
aside and is consumed with her deep sorrow. She had
won the sympathy of Achilles after the talk with the
old servant, vs. 896–1035, and following the choral song
appears again to seek Agamemnon whom neither she
nor Iphigeneia had seen since the terrible truth of the
marriage was disclosed. She calls her daughter from
the house, v. 1117, and bids her</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c022'>All of these figures occur on the cup, so that in a
certain sense the whole scene from v. 1122 to v. 1275 is
illustrated. The position of Klytaimestra and Iphigeneia
would, however, lead one to think that the latter’s long
appeal was particularly in the mind of the artist. She
recounts in words, as eloquent as they are pathetic, the
promises her father had once made to her as a child,
and goes over all the ambitions that had filled her
girlish heart in the happy Argive home.</p>

<p class='c022'>There is certainly inspiration enough in these verses
for a more pretentious group than the simple terra cotta
cup presents, but lacking all other Greek monuments
bearing upon this scene one may prize this witness
as a valuable inheritance from the Hellenistic period.
Agamemnon speaks; he loves his child and realizes
full well the meaning of the sacrifice, but he must obey
the clamourings of the Greeks.</p>

<p class='c009'>Iphigeneia and her mother remain alone with the
chorus and bewail the bitterness of their sorrow, vs.
1276–1345, when a company of men is observed approaching.
Among them is Achilles. His attempt
to intercede in behalf of the doomed Iphigeneia had
been of no avail. The Achaeans were inexorable; her
blood must be spilt. Nevertheless he promises them
his assistance, and encourages Klytaimestra to resist
Odysseus and the others who come to drag her daughter
away to the altar, vs. 1338–1433. The early part of
this scene is recognizable in the remaining group.</p>

We have then precisely the situation in the lines quoted.</p>

<p class='c009'>The sacrifice which followed, was attended by the
marvellous wonder, and it was to be expected that if
any <em>one</em> incident of the tragedy was told in art it would
be the scene at the altar. Our little monument curiously
enough stops where <em>all</em> the others begin. We are taken
step by step up to the final act and there we are left.
The works enumerated above<a id='r220' /><a href='#f220' class='c020'><sup>[220]</sup></a> are, without exception,
confined to the moment of the sacrifice. The famous
wall painting and the Florence altar have much in
common with the renowned painting of Timanthes, and
all three are conceived in the spirit of Euripides as far
as the actions of Agamemnon are concerned.</p>

<p class='c022'>And so he stands completely wrapped in his mantle,
exposing no part of his face. In this invention lay
the unsurpassed success which Timanthes enjoyed with
his painting. The dates for this artist allow us to place
the work subsequent to the production of the <cite>Iphigeneia</cite>
in 405 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>, and credit Euripides with influencing Timanthes.
This is at least possible, but does not admit
of proof. It appears to me very likely that all three
of these works are more or less closely connected with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>each other and with Euripides. The Etruscan ash-urns on the other hand, as well as the vase painting
in the British Museum<a id='r221' /><a href='#f221' class='c020'><sup>[221]</sup></a>, follow a totally different version
of the story. In these cases Agamemnon himself takes
the part of the priest in the ceremony, and performs
the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀπαρχαί</span>. So far from being the tender-hearted
father who cannot even stand and watch the offering, he
draws the fatal knife or pours the sacrificial liquid upon
the victim’s head. Traces of this turn are found early
in tragedy<a id='r222' /><a href='#f222' class='c020'><sup>[222]</sup></a>, but this is an Agamemnon with a far
different heart from the one we follow in the <cite>Iphigeneia</cite>
of Euripides. Even though the part from v. 1532
till the close of the play be thrown out as an interpolation,
the character of Agamemnon in the first 1500
verses could not have changed so suddenly at the end
that he would have taken the place of Kalchas at the
altar. This set of monuments does not, therefore, give
us the Euripidean spirit.</p>

<h3 class='c019'>§ 7. <span class='sc'>Iphigeneia among the Taurians.</span></h3>

<p class='c018'>Euripides in all probability created in the life of
Iphigeneia the chapter concerning her return to Greece
with Orestes. There is at any rate no trace of this turn
in preceding authors. Homer does not appear to have
known any such a daughter of Agamemnon, unless one
is to seek to identify Iphigeneia with Iphianassa. The
‘king of men’ speaks of</p>

<p class='c022'>as his three daughters. We know, however, from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>Sophokles<a id='r223' /><a href='#f223' class='c020'><sup>[223]</sup></a> that Iphianassa was distinguished from
Iphigeneia. Since Homer has not even her name there
is no allusion to the catastrophe at Aulis. It is first
in the <cite>Kypria</cite><a id='r224' /><a href='#f224' class='c020'><sup>[224]</sup></a>, a work usually accredited to Stasinos in
the early part of the eighth century <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>, that reference
is made to the gathered hosts at Aulis, the calm, the
sacrifice. It was not Iphigeneia, however, who was the
victim, for Artemis had suddenly intervened and, having
taken her away to the Black Sea country, had blessed
her with immortality. From this date then the myth
may have been widely spread among the Greeks.
Hesiod related in his <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Κατάλογος γυναικῶν</span> that Iphigeneia
had received the gift of immortality from Artemis, thus
following closely the author of the <cite>Kypria</cite><a id='r225' /><a href='#f225' class='c020'><sup>[225]</sup></a>. Herodotos
also repeats the same story<a id='r226' /><a href='#f226' class='c020'><sup>[226]</sup></a>. One looks in vain for
any trace of her delivery from this wild people, until
the latter part of Euripides’ life. Then it is that new
light breaks in upon the old orthodox form of the myth:
the mortal side of Iphigeneia is made to assume a new
interest for the world, and she, who had been long lost
amidst a wild, barbarous people, is suddenly restored
to her only hope, Orestes. This is the work of ‘Euripides,
the human, with his droppings of warm tears.’
With this tragedy the poet created at once a definite
chapter in dramatic literature and furnished another
impetus for ancient art.</p>

<p class='c009'>There are traces of two other Greek tragedies dealing
with this same subject; yet the play of Timestheos is
a mere name<a id='r227' /><a href='#f227' class='c020'><sup>[227]</sup></a>, while that of Polyeidos is but little more.
Aristotle, however, has given a certain prominence to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>the latter work by making two references to it in his
<cite>Poetics</cite><a id='r228' /><a href='#f228' class='c020'><sup>[228]</sup></a>. This differed from the play of Euripides
particularly in the recognition scene. The <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀναγνώρισις</span>
was brought about by Orestes using the words ‘and
shall I too be sacrificed?’ Who but Orestes was likely
to know aught of the attempt once made to sacrifice her
at Aulis? It is worthy of note that the <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">libretto</span></i> of
Glück’s opera also follows this manner of the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">dénouement</span></i>.
Among the Latin dramatists we hear that Naevius
wrote a play called <cite>Iphigenia</cite>. One verse only is
preserved<a id='r229' /><a href='#f229' class='c020'><sup>[229]</sup></a>. It goes without saying that the tragedy
was taken from the Greek, but from what author it is
worthless to conjecture. The <cite>Dolorestes</cite> of Pacuvius was
long thought to deal with the same subject, but this
has been shown to be of an entirely different character.
It is altogether improbable that these Latin versions
worked any radical change in the Euripidean form of
the myth. It is true that the story was remodelled in
some particulars; Hyginus, e.g. in <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">fabula</span></i> 261, relates
that the bones of Orestes had been brought from Aricia
to Rome and had been interred before the temple of
Saturn! Such a violent contortion of the myth may be
laid to the credit of a poet<a id='r230' /><a href='#f230' class='c020'><sup>[230]</sup></a>, but I would prefer to
recognize in the words of Hyginus the influence of the
mythological handbooks which were written up in
a manner well calculated to pamper the national pride
of the Romans.</p>

<p class='c009'>In no work written subsequent to Euripides is it
possible to detect the sources for the representations
of the myth in art; in all cases the poet of the fifth
century <span class='fss'>B.C.</span> can be shown to have wielded his absolute
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>power. We shall see in the discussion of the vase
paintings based upon the play that this class of monuments
is not the only one in which the new Iphigeneia
found her place. The Etruscan urns and mirrors, the
wall paintings of Pompeii and of Herculaneum, the
Roman sarcophagi, as well as pastes and gems, all
furnish an extensive field in which parallel scenes may
be traced.</p>

<p class='c009'>This introduces the consideration of the vases and
their relation to the tragedy. They fall readily into
three classes corresponding to three well-defined stages
in the play: 1. Orestes and Pylades alone upon the
Taurian coast are surprised, and led by the shepherds
to the king and Iphigeneia (vs. 67–466). 2. The scene
following, in which it is determined that not both shall
be killed, but that one, and he Pylades, shall be allowed
to return to Mykenai, bearing a message from Iphigeneia
(vs. 467–724). 3. The handing over of the letter and the
accompanying explanation, whereby Orestes and his
sister recognize each other (vs. 725–1088). There follow
two other well-defined scenes which are not traceable on
vases<a id='r231' /><a href='#f231' class='c020'><sup>[231]</sup></a>. 4. The escape with the Artemis idol (vs. 1152–1233),
and 5. the messenger’s speech which relates the
manner of the escape.</p>

<p class='c009'>There is but one vase painting that can be assigned to
the first step in the play. The painting is a thoroughly
ugly and, from an artistic standpoint, worthless specimen
that represents the very decadence of ceramic art<a id='r232' /><a href='#f232' class='c020'><sup>[232]</sup></a>.
The vase is a slender amphora with three zones of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>pictures; ours is the middle one. On the left a woman
in chiton and mantle sits with head turned to the right,
her left hand resting on a sceptre or staff and her right
on her knee. She wears a necklace and on one arm
a bracelet. Standing before her with outstretched right
hand is a bearded male figure in short chiton and mantle,
and a spear in his left; he has just arrived, as one may
conclude from the position of his feet. Immediately
following are two youths entirely naked, hands pinioned
behind their backs. The ends of the ropes seem to be
held by the group of three youths following, who are
dressed as the first male figure except that two of them
wear boots. Their attention, like that of all, is directed
towards the female figure.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id003'>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>Fig. 17.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The arrest of Orestes and Pylades is given here, and
more definitely their appearance before Iphigeneia. To be
sure the manner is entirely different from that on other
monuments. One expects Iphigeneia to be in or near
the temple of Artemis and to be represented in a more
concerned and active attitude; and furthermore, one
looks for the altar (v. 72), and some indication of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>fate which awaits the captives. All these features are
wanting. That the artist endeavoured to represent the
meeting of the priestess and the two Greeks can, however,
admit of no doubt; that the necessary setting of the
scene was omitted need be no more a matter of surprise
to one than the helpless workmanship of the whole.
The monument is valuable as being the only vase
painting showing the first scene, which is never wanting
on the sarcophagi<a id='r233' /><a href='#f233' class='c020'><sup>[233]</sup></a>. This moment occurs likewise on
certain other monuments<a id='r234' /><a href='#f234' class='c020'><sup>[234]</sup></a>. The shepherd relates (vs.
260–339) how the discovery and capture were made;
how they learned that one of the two was named
Pylades; and further that the prisoners had been conducted
first to the king, who after glancing at them
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐσιδών</span>) sent them to Artemis and her priestess.
Iphigeneia says to the boukolos in v. 342, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">σὺ μὲν κόμιζε
τοὺς ξένους μολών</span>, and in v. 467, after her soliloquy and
the song of the chorus, she appears again on the stage
where she meets the captives. This is the moment,
very largely modified, which the painting represents.
Iphigeneia’s first words are—</p>

<div class='lg-container-l c021'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in18'><span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μέθετε τῶν ξένων χέρας,</span></div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c022'>At this the guards are commanded to enter the temple
and make ready for the offering. Our picture follows
in one respect the traditional manner of representing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>the scene. Orestes and Pylades are invariably nude, or
so lightly clad with the chlamys that they are practically
naked. There is the closest analogy between them as
they appear here and as they occur on the sarcophagi.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id003'>
<img src='images/i_p127.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p>Fig. 18.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The second moment, as I have marked it out above,
is also represented on one vase only<a id='r235' /><a href='#f235' class='c020'><sup>[235]</sup></a>. In the centre
Orestes, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ΟΡΕΣΤΑΣ</span>, sits to the right upon a large altar,
chlamys about his hips, sword on his left side, hands
supported upon his stick towards which his head is sunk.
The whole attitude betokens sorrow. On the right
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>is Iphigeneia wearing long, sleeved chiton, and mantle,
necklace, and bracelets. In her left hand<a id='t128'></a> close by her side (incorrectly
published as a knife) is the temple key which
is emblematic of her office as <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κλῃδοῦχος</span><a id='r236' /><a href='#f236' class='c020'><sup>[236]</sup></a>. Her right
is extended towards Orestes, with whom she is speaking.
She is accompanied by a temple servant who, entirely
wrapped in chiton and mantle, carries in her right an
oinochoë and upon her head a dish in which are articles
for the sacrifice, including the branches for sprinkling.
Behind Orestes is a laurel tree and on his right Pylades,
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ΠΥΛΑΔΗΣ</span>, standing with one foot thrown over the
other, his right hand placed sorrowfully to his head.
The left rests upon his staff. On his left side is a sword.
He is deeply concerned in the conversation. Above on
the right behind a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">terrain</span></i> is the temple of Artemis,
Ionic order, and akroteria. Beside it on the left,
Artemis, distinguished by her huntress-mantle, two
spears, and hair-dress, sits with face to the left towards
Apollo who is the remaining figure on the vase. He
wears a garment around his waist, and rests his right
upon a cane and turns his face towards Artemis.</p>

<p class='c009'>The vase is especially interesting as being the only
one on which any of the characters is accompanied by
an inscription, and secondly, because Orestes sits here
upon the altar. He cannot be thought of as a victim,
and I do not believe he has fled to the altar for refuge,
as has been suggested. That would comport but poorly
with the spirit which he exhibits throughout the interview.
Where does Orestes sit passively upon an altar
at the attack of the Furies? He invariably has his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>sword drawn in a very emphatic manner, and while he
crouches upon or clings to the altar he never gives any
appearance of being an easy victim to his pursuers<a id='r237' /><a href='#f237' class='c020'><sup>[237]</sup></a>.
Just this point it is necessary to emphasize, for had the
artist felt that the meaning of Orestes’ position indicated
his pursuit either by seen or unseen Furies, he never
would have committed the egregious error of placing
him in a calm attitude quite unconscious that he has
a <em>sword ready at his side</em>. Furthermore there is no trace
in Euripides or the painting to allow us to assume that
Orestes is again pursued at this point. He is not,
therefore, in any sense a suppliant. The vase painter
has simply allowed himself a great liberty in seating his
figure where we should least expect to find him. An
altar is not by any means a usual seat, and much less for
the victim<a id='r238' /><a href='#f238' class='c020'><sup>[238]</sup></a>. This same freedom in disposing of details
led the decorator still further from the established usage,
for neither of the captives should be allowed their
swords. They are already <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἱεροί</span> (v. 469) and should be
represented accordingly. In these particulars we must
acknowledge that the painter idealized the scene (vs.
472 ff.).</p>

<p class='c009'>If it were necessary to determine upon any one
moment which the artist had in mind, one would discover
a close parallel between vs. 625 ff. and the present
scene. It has been agreed that Pylades shall be the
messenger; Orestes is to die in his stead. The latter
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>proceeds to ask who shall perform the sacrificial act, and
whether a tomb shall receive him when all is over. To
this Iphigeneia replies—</p>

    <div class='group'>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c022'>I can conceive of no more pitiable and hopeless condition
than that of the unfortunate Orestes which the poet
depicts. At this point his course seemed all in vain;
Apollo’s promise appeared to be a farce, and Heaven
and Earth seemed wrought into one violent confusion
(cf. vs. 572 f. and 711). Perhaps it was at this juncture
that he most impressed the painter, and we may see
the wretched Orestes prostrate upon the altar in this
moment of extreme despair.</p>

<p class='c009'>Artemis and Apollo take no part in the action, but
there is a greater fitness in their position as spectators
than is often the case with the gods on the vases of
Lower Italy. The former is a natural figure in her
own precinct, by her own temple, while Apollo, as her
brother, properly balances the scene. The latter, moreover,
stands in so close a relation to Orestes’ trial and
delivery that he is a most appropriate beholder of the
progress of this his own enterprise (cf. v. 977).</p>

<p class='c009'>Mention should be made here of the sarcophagi, on
which essentially the same scene is found. The agreement
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>with our vase is striking<a id='r239' /><a href='#f239' class='c020'><sup>[239]</sup></a>. Orestes sits with his
head wrapped in his mantle and drooping on his lap,
while Pylades stands before him, always in the same
attitude, one leg thrown over the other, one hand
clutching his hair and the other resting on his stick.
This is a striking coincidence, indeed, in these two classes
of monuments, separated by at least four hundred years.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the third step of the tragedy we are more fortunate
and possess among vase paintings at least three that
represent the transmission of the letter to Pylades, and
the accompanying recognition between Orestes and his
sister. It is not surprising that the supreme moment in
the action should have attracted the artists, and that on
the sarcophagi<a id='r240' /><a href='#f240' class='c020'><sup>[240]</sup></a> also this unique point in Greek tragedy
should have been represented<a id='r241' /><a href='#f241' class='c020'><sup>[241]</sup></a>.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id003'>

<img src='images/i_p132.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p>Fig. 19.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>1. The best known of the vases is an amphora formerly
in the possession of the Duke of Buckingham<a id='r242' /><a href='#f242' class='c020'><sup>[242]</sup></a>. In
front of the temple of Artemis, Doric order, stands
Iphigeneia, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en face</span></i>, in richly embroidered chiton, and
high head-dress from which falls a sort of veil reaching
to the knees. She wears necklace, bracelets, earrings,
and sandals; her costume bespeaks in every respect
that of the theatre. She carries again the token of her
office in the left, and hands the letter to Pylades with
the right, who stands ready for the journey, wearing
chlamys, pilos, boots, and carrying two spears. Further,
on the left, leaning against the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">περιρῥαντήριον</span> is Orestes,
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en face</span></i>, but with laurel-wreathed head turned towards
Pylades; his right leg is thrown over the left. He
wears a chlamys, and carries two spears and a sword.
Beside Iphigeneia is her servant, as in fig. 18, but with
a simple girdled chiton, and in her right the dish with
articles for the altar which is represented in poor perspective
behind Iphigeneia. Above, on the right, before
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>the temple doors, is Artemis in short, huntress-costume
and high Thracian boots; two spears in her left, and
a burning torch in her right. She wears the Thracian
cap. On the left of the temple behind a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">terrain</span></i> is a young
satyr, no doubt thrown in to fill up the space.</p>

<p class='c009'>2. The largest painting representing this scene is that
on an amphora in St. Petersburg<a id='r243' /><a href='#f243' class='c020'><sup>[243]</sup></a>. The centre of the
picture is taken up by the temple, four Ionic columns.
Inside on the right is the Artemis statue, costumed like
Artemis in fig. 19; a burning torch in the right, around
which is bound a sort of decoration. It is on a large
pedestal, and has in the left a spear. On the left, about
to leave the temple, is Iphigeneia with an elegant chiton,
mantle, a diadem in hair, and the peculiar key in her
left; beside her, and leaning against the wall, is a kylix
with long handle. She makes a gesture towards Pylades
with her right in which there is no letter. He stands
on the left by the temple, leaning against his knotty
stick; has petasos on the back of the neck, and wears
high boots and an escaping chlamys. On the left, lower
down, Orestes leans on the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">περιρῥαντήριον</span>, as in fig. 19,
but he is evidently more dejected here. The rest of the
painting, which consists of five groups of two figures
each, has so little to do with the central scene that we
may omit any description of it. In the upper zone on
the right are Hermes and Artemis, on the left Athena
and Nike. Athena will observe the final part of the
affair in which she was so deeply interested in Athens.
The two groups, a female and an armed Thracian,
represent the common ‘love-scenes’ on this class of
vases. For the third group on the right, the artist
preferred to draw a young deer instead of the female
figure. Stephani<a id='r244' /><a href='#f244' class='c020'><sup>[244]</sup></a> is correct in calling these ‘love-scenes,’
and so separating them permanently from any
part in the action. Countless such groups are thrown
upon vases of this style as meaningless, decorative
figures. The parasol, wreaths, and vessels serve to
enrich the setting and add charm to the coquetry.</p>

</div>

<p class='c009'>3. A vase, formerly in the possession of the art dealer
Barone in Naples, shows an abridgement of the scene<a id='r245' /><a href='#f245' class='c020'><sup>[245]</sup></a>.
In an Ionic temple, four columns, and akroteria, Iphigeneia,
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en face</span></i>, long chiton, mantle, hair done in a knot
behind, leans with her left elbow upon the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">βρέτας</span>. In
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>her left is the temple attribute, and in the right the
letter which she extends to Pylades, in chlamys and
petasos. He leans against his stick, and has a sword
in the left, while he points with the right towards the
letter. On the right are Apollo and Artemis. The
former, nude except for a mantle and high boots, grasps
the laurel tree with his left, and rests his right upon
Artemis’ shoulder, who sits to the left upon the altar
and looks up to Apollo. She is dressed as usual with
short chiton and high boots. She has two spears in the
left.</p>

<p class='c009'>In setting these three paintings over against each
other and comparing the elements in them, the uniformity
is very striking. Perhaps the details may be
clearer if placed in a sort of scheme.</p>

<p class='c008'><em>a.</em> Elements common to all three vases.</p>

<p class='c009'>1. Temple of Artemis. 2. Iphigeneia in elaborate
dress, indicated as the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κλῃδοῦχος</span>. 3. A youth in travelling
costume, with whom she is talking. 4. Artemis on the
<em>right</em> of the temple.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>b.</em> Elements common to two of the three vases.</p>

<p class='c009'>1. In figs. 19 and 20 a youth leans against the
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">περιρῥαντήριον</span>, resting on one leg over which the other
is thrown. 2. In figs. 19 and 21 Iphigeneia hands the
letter to the youth. 3. The Artemis <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἄγαλμα</span> is in the
temple in figs. 20 and 21; so also is Iphigeneia.</p>

<p class='c008'>We thus observe that the remarkable agreement, even
in the details, shows that they must all be copies more
or less exact of one and the same original. That
Iphigeneia in fig. 20 does not hold the letter in her
hand may be accredited to the carelessness of the artist
who merely forgot to paint it. The same may be said
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>with regard to the abridged form of the scene in fig. 21,
where Orestes has been left out. The two central figures
appeared to the artist to be the important part of the
original, and accordingly he omitted all else.</p>

<p class='c009'>Immediately following the scene represented in
fig. 18, Iphigeneia entered the temple to get the letter—</p>

<div class='lg-container-l c021'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀλλ’ εἶμι, δέλτον τ’ ἐκ θεᾶς ανακτόρων</span></div>
      <div class='line'><span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">οἴσω</span>. v. 636 f.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c022'>and ordered the guards to watch the two without
binding them. Thereafter ensues the touching scene
between Orestes and Pylades (vs. 657–724). The
priestess then reappears, and commanding the attendants
to go inside, continues—</p>

<div class='lg-container-l c021'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">δέλτου μὲν αἵδε πολύθυροι διαπτυχαί,</span></div>
      <div class='line'><span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ξένοι, πάρεισιν· ἃ δ’ ἐπὶ τοῖσδε βούλομαι,</span></div>
      <div class='line'><span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀκούσατ’</span>.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c022'>Orestes speaks first after these lines and asks her what
she wishes. It shall be an oath for the safe delivery of
the letter. At this he demands a counter-oath from her
for the safe withdrawal of Pylades from the country.
We may imagine that during the delivery of these
verses, which were probably spoken while Iphigeneia
was still in the temple doorway, Pylades had approached
her to receive the letter, while Orestes stepped to one
side as he appears in figs. 19 and 20. In vs. 769–787
the contents of the letter are related to ensure safe
transfer of the message, even though the written words
be lost in a shipwreck. This is the time represented on
our vases. The hopelessness of Orestes requires, moreover,
the earlier part of the scene, since from v. 772 he
begins to be aroused and to prove his brotherhood to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>Iphigeneia. The <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">αναγνώρισις</span> is complete at the close
of v. 826, and there follow the fourth and fifth stages
which were noticed above<a id='r246' /><a href='#f246' class='c020'><sup>[246]</sup></a>. Neither of these movements
is, so far as I am aware, shown on any vase
painting, although they are an important part of the
reliefs on the Roman sarcophagi<a id='r247' /><a href='#f247' class='c020'><sup>[247]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c009'>In conclusion, mention should be made of the wall
paintings which represent the departure of the three
with the statue to purify it in the sea. The first and
most important of these is the fine <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">casa del citarista</span></i>
painting<a id='r248' /><a href='#f248' class='c020'><sup>[248]</sup></a>. Robert first correctly recognized the right
meaning of this beautiful monument and based it upon
the poet<a id='r249' /><a href='#f249' class='c020'><sup>[249]</sup></a>, thereby bringing it into harmony with the
sarcophagi. That he was happily correct in reading the
time in the painting <em>after the recognition</em>, contrary to
Helbig’s interpretation<a id='r250' /><a href='#f250' class='c020'><sup>[250]</sup></a>, is nicely borne out by the
painting recently discovered in the <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">casa dei Vettii</span></i><a id='r251' /><a href='#f251' class='c020'><sup>[251]</sup></a>,
which is another copy of the same original<a id='r252' /><a href='#f252' class='c020'><sup>[252]</sup></a>. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>variations are, however, enough to render any misunderstanding
of it impossible. Here there is no temple, and
Iphigeneia occupies the centre between Orestes and
Pylades on the left, and Thoas on the right. She
carries plainly the temple <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">βρέτας</span> on the left shoulder.
Furthermore, the unconcerned attitude of the two
prisoners in their <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tête-à-tête</span></i> points clearly to the proper
significance of the scene. Curiously enough Orestes
appears to sit on the altar here as on the vase painting,
fig. 18.</p>

<h3 class='c019'>§ 8. <span class='sc'>Kyklops.</span></h3>

<p class='c018'>The satyr dance, the earliest form of the Greek drama
and the simple beginning from which the immense
superstructure of tragedy took its start, continued, in
the satyr composition which followed the regular trilogy,
to remind the public of the original plan and tendency
of the performances in honour of Dionysos<a id='r253' /><a href='#f253' class='c020'><sup>[253]</sup></a>. Till late in
the fourth century <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>, at least, this echo of the original
Dionysiac festival remained in vogue. The <cite>Kyklops</cite> of
Euripides is the only example of this sort of composition
which has reached us, and although the present work is
concerned with tragedy and vase paintings I cannot
refrain from including here a painting that is under the
influence of this unique relic of Greek literature. The
connexion between the satyr-play and tragedy is
certainly intimate enough to warrant the introduction
of the present chapter.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>Every one is acquainted with the story of Odysseus’
adventure with the Kyklops Polyphemos. Since the
author of the <cite>Odyssey</cite> threw a charm around the story,
this event in the wanderings of the hero has remained
one of the most popular. In early Greek art there are
numerous monuments based upon the myth. The black
figured vases represent two critical moments. 1. The
blinding of Polyphemos. 2. The escape of Odysseus
and his companion from the cave. A long list of
paintings tells this story over and over again, with little
variation<a id='r254' /><a href='#f254' class='c020'><sup>[254]</sup></a>. The artists evidently became tired of the
monotony of the subject, for it is practically dead at the
beginning of the fifth century. There was nothing new
in the tale; it was distinctly epic, and for this very
reason had its day and gave way to new motives in the
dramatic literature. At the end of the century there was
a revival of the myth. It gained a new lease of life through
the <cite>Kyklops</cite> of Euripides, and once again all eyes were
turned towards the old Homeric fiction. When the poet
introduces Seilenos and his company of satyrs as slaves
to Polyphemos, and turns the fortunes of Odysseus, on
his arrival at the cave, by the intervention of this new
element, the artist had certainly a new incentive. The
rollicking, lusty antics of the tribe of satyrs had ever
been the red figured vase painter’s delight, and when
Euripides connected them with the adventures of
Odysseus and the Kyklops the old story was ingrafted
with a vigorous shoot<a id='r255' /><a href='#f255' class='c020'><sup>[255]</sup></a>. Timanthes, whom we have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>already met<a id='r256' /><a href='#f256' class='c020'><sup>[256]</sup></a>, very likely owed it to Euripides that he
associated Polyphemos with satyrs<a id='r257' /><a href='#f257' class='c020'><sup>[257]</sup></a>. An interesting
vase painting, which may be dated <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">cir.</span></i> 410 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>, bears
strong testimony to the influence of the <cite>Kyklops</cite> in
Lower Italy<a id='r258' /><a href='#f258' class='c020'><sup>[258]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>Fig. 22.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The picture appears in fig. 22. In the foreground
Polyphemos lies stretched out in his drunken stupour<a id='r259' /><a href='#f259' class='c020'><sup>[259]</sup></a>;
beside him is a stump on which hangs an empty wineskin,
and on the ground a bowl. In the centre three
youths, the middle one wearing a pilos, are busy tugging
at a log. Two others on the left bring fire-wood to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>kindle the large stick<a id='r260' /><a href='#f260' class='c020'><sup>[260]</sup></a>; another youth, probably
Odysseus, in pilos and chlamys, directs the work from
the opposite side. Two bearded satyrs, with the usual
horse-tails, caper around on the right<a id='r261' /><a href='#f261' class='c020'><sup>[261]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c009'>The whole painting breathes with the spirit running
through the <cite>Kyklops</cite>. The impression gained by
reading the play is remarkably well supported by
a study of the former. There is no detailed agreement
between the two which strikes one, for the situations in
Euripides are not closely followed. There is, however,
the same stamp of originality and newness characterizing
both. The painting is a revelation to one who has seen
only the earlier Homeric monuments.</p>

<p class='c009'>It may first be noticed that Polyphemos is represented
outside of his cave, and that the attack upon his big eye
is about to take place. This is quite opposed to Homer
and Euripides, yet more than half the charm of the
scene lies in the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">naïveté</span></i> with which the artist disposes of
the giant. A glance at the words of the poet will make
this clearer. Odysseus and his chorus of satyrs have
fixed upon the means for overcoming the Kyklops.
They beg Odysseus for permission to take a hand in
preparing the fatal pole;</p>

The two satyrs, representing the chorus, dance around
lustily the while, having smelt the contents of the wineskin
(v. 153 f.). As soon as the plan has been decided
upon, Polyphemos appears again, having already sated
his appetite on two of the Greeks, and having had at
least a taste of the wine. What could prepare one
better for the appreciation of the figure on the vase than
his own words?</p>

<p class='c022'>There can be little doubt that these verses particularly
interested the artist. Well satisfied with the newly
discovered drink, the Kyklops has dropped down upon
his side as Seilenos recommended. The <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀσκός</span>, which
he ordered extra, hangs beside him and upon the ground
is a bowl<a id='r262' /><a href='#f262' class='c020'><sup>[262]</sup></a>. Both of these have evidently been drained.
The inhuman monster sleeps on, quite in the manner of
Euripides, in the presence of the active preparations for
his own ruin.</p>

<h3 class='c019'>§ 9. <span class='sc'>Medeia.</span></h3>

<p class='c018'>The heroine of this tragedy of Euripides is one of the
most imposing and terrible figures that has come down
to us from ancient Greek literature. It is not, however,
the magician of strange power, who assisted Jason in
winning the Golden Fleece and in performing his other
Kolchian adventures, that overawes one; neither is it
the sorceress who worked her wonders on Pelias, but
rather the Medeia who avenged her slighted honour
through the destruction of Jason’s newly won bride and
his two sons; it is the Medeia <em>at Corinth</em> that we know
best, the Medeia of Euripides. This chapter in the
barbarian’s career assumed under his hand a prominence
which far exceeded anything that had gone before.
Euripides’ Medeia has remained ever since <em>the</em> Medeia of
art and letters.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>In early Greek art Medeia is not a common figure,
and when she does occur it is invariably as the sorceress<a id='r263' /><a href='#f263' class='c020'><sup>[263]</sup></a>.
In this rôle one meets her on both black and red figured
vases<a id='r264' /><a href='#f264' class='c020'><sup>[264]</sup></a>, and on the famous relief in the Lateran<a id='r265' /><a href='#f265' class='c020'><sup>[265]</sup></a>. After
the beginning of the fourth century <span class='fss'>B.C.</span> the Corinthian
Medeia predominates. As such one finds her on vases
from Lower Italy, Apulia and Campania especially, on
Pompeian wall paintings<a id='r266' /><a href='#f266' class='c020'><sup>[266]</sup></a>, on terra cottas<a id='r267' /><a href='#f267' class='c020'><sup>[267]</sup></a>, gems<a id='r268' /><a href='#f268' class='c020'><sup>[268]</sup></a>, and
the Roman sarcophagi<a id='r269' /><a href='#f269' class='c020'><sup>[269]</sup></a>.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>The most famous vase upon which we find Medeia is
the great amphora in Munich<a id='r270' /><a href='#f270' class='c020'><sup>[270]</sup></a>, found in Canosa, the
ancient Canusium, in Apulia, Oct. 16, 1813. The
painting consists of three sections of figures parallel with
the perimeter of the vase. The two upper ones are
divided in the middle by a building with six Ionic
columns. On the inside hang two round shields—a
common decoration in this sort of picture. On the
right, inside of the house, is a chair or <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">θρόνος</span>, over the
arm-rest of which a richly dressed female figure has
fallen; above on the frieze the inscription <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ΚΡΕΟΝΤΕΙΑ</span>
(sc. <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ΠΑΙΣ</span>) shows the person to be Kreusa, or Glauke<a id='r271' /><a href='#f271' class='c020'><sup>[271]</sup></a>,
the daughter of Kreon. Rushing rapidly towards her
from the right is a youth in petasos and chlamys. He
has already reached the upper step of the palace and
is attempting to remove Kreusa’s head-dress. Incised
in the vase is the name <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ΙΠΠΟΤΗΣ</span><a id='r272' /><a href='#f272' class='c020'><sup>[272]</sup></a>. On the left an
elderly male figure, bearded, wearing long, richly embroidered
chiton, hurries to Kreusa. One hand is placed
behind her as though to support the body; the other,
from which the sceptre has just fallen, clutches his hair.
He gazes to one side in a dazed sort of manner. On
the frieze above is <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ΩΝ</span>, evidently the last letters of
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ΚΡΕΩΝ</span><a id='r273' /><a href='#f273' class='c020'><sup>[273]</sup></a>. To the left outside of the palace, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>somewhat lower, an elderly woman in long chiton and
mantle runs toward the scene of the tragedy, extending
her left hand and holding her right to her head in the
usual attitude of fright. She is designated by the inscription,
incised, as <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ΜΕΡΟΠΗ</span><a id='r274' /><a href='#f274' class='c020'><sup>[274]</sup></a>—most likely the wife
of Kreon. Further on the left is a group of two,
a pedagogue in the usual costume, and a female
attendant. The former is hurrying towards the palace,
while the latter attempts to divert him from his onward
rush.</p>

<p class='c009'>To the right from Hippotes is another female figure,
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en face</span></i>, who appears to be leaving the palace. Her
dress, especially the veil, and her bearing point her out
as a nurse or servant of Kreusa. Just in front of the
latter upon the ground is the open box in which the
baneful presents were brought.</p>

<p class='c009'>The lower section is divided into two parts by
Medeia’s dragon-chariot, held in readiness by the
charioteer with a burning torch in either hand. The
upper part of the latter’s body is nude. There can be
little doubt that the figure is female. The inscription
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ΟΙΣΤΡΟΣ</span> shows it to be <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Οἴστρος</span>, the personification of
Medeia’s rage. On the left, Medeia, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ΜΗΔΕΙΑ</span><a id='r275' /><a href='#f275' class='c020'><sup>[275]</sup></a>, with
richly decorated oriental costume and Phrygian cap,
advances to the right with drawn sword to kill one son
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>whom she grasps by the hair with the left hand. It is
not easy to say whether the boy has taken refuge on the
altar, or whether his mother has lifted him upon it.
More probably the latter is true. The lad is nude, with
the exception of a garment over his left shoulder. He
wears bracelets and on the left leg an anklet. Immediately
behind Medeia a doryphoros, dressed as Hippotes,
but with two spears instead of a sword, hurries to the
left with the second boy, dressed as is the other. On
the right of the chariot and hastening impetuously to
rescue his son is Jason, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ΙΑΣΩΝ</span>. He is bearded and
has a sword and long spear. His chlamys is thrown
over his left arm. Beside him, but moving at slackened
speed, another doryphoros extends the right hand
towards the chariot as though to warn Jason of the
futility of his intervention. Above this group on
the right is a bearded male figure, pointing towards the
events transpiring below. He wears a long royal dress
and Phrygian cap, and carries a sceptre in his left.
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ΕΙΔΩΛΟΝ ΑΗΤΟΥ</span>, incised, indicates him as the ghost
of Aetes, Medeia’s father.</p>

<p class='c009'>The upper section is bounded on either side by a
Corinthian column surmounted by a tripod. Herakles,
with club, bow and quiver, and lion’s skin, stands on the
left facing Athene, who sits upon a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">terrain</span></i>. She has her
helmet in her right hand and leans against her shield.
The spear is not wanting. On the right are two male
figures, one sitting, the other standing. The oil-cruses
and strigils, as well as the two stars and the pilos, near
the one who sits, designate them as the Dioskouroi.</p>

<p class='c009'>We turn now to a closer consideration of our vase to
see if it is under the influence of Euripides. Starting
with the scene which the vase painter has given us in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>Kreon’s palace, one cannot but be struck with the
agreement between the picture and the scene described
by the poet through the mouth of the messenger in the
celebrated speech, vs. 1136–1230. This wonderful
passage is the triumph of Euripidean rhetoric in the
<cite>Medeia</cite>. The two boys, together with their father, had
entered Kreusa’s apartment conveying the box with the
rich vestment and golden crown, and she, who had
refused to listen to words and be softened, was, woman-like,
melted by these unexpected gifts. She accepts
them, and father and sons retire. She then arrays
herself before the mirror, admires her beauty, retreats
across the room with proud, exulting step, all too
captivated by her gracious figure, when the terrible
moment comes—</p>

<div class='lg-container-l c021'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">χροιὰν γὰρ ἀλλάξασα λεχρία πάλιν</span></div>

      <div class='line'><span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">θρόνοισιν ἐμπεσοῦσα μὴ χαμαὶ πεσεῖν</span>. vs. 1168–1170.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c022'>There is a remarkable harmony between these words
and the picture upon the vase, where Kreusa lies a
helpless mass across the arms of the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">θρόνος</span>. Her
attitude suggests to one’s mind exactly the idea in
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">θρόνοισιν ἐμπεσοῦσα μὴ χαμαὶ πεσεῖν</span>. Rarely has a vase
painter come nearer to <em>illustration</em> than here. It had,
indeed, been far easier to paint Kreusa in her fallen
position upon the floor, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πίτνει δ’ ἐς οὖδας</span> (v. 1195), where
the chair and the form of the body would have presented
no such difficulties in drawing as they do in the present
position<a id='r276' /><a href='#f276' class='c020'><sup>[276]</sup></a>. Why was this not done? Simply, as I am
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>convinced, because the painter chose to present the most
tragic moments, and shape them into the greatest possible
dramatic effect. He seized the crisis in Kreusa’s dread
struggle, when, doomed by the poison and flames, she
<em>dropped</em> across the chair. Here, as in the scene below,
the vase painter has given evidence of dramatic power of
a high degree, and I venture to think that had he not
been an artist he would have been a tragedian.</p>

<p class='c009'>Kreon, who, of course, could not be represented as
falling upon the body of Kreusa as he entered the room,
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἄφνω προσελθὼν δῶμα προσπίτνει νεκρῷ</span> (v. 1205), while
she was still resting on the chair<a id='r277' /><a href='#f277' class='c020'><sup>[277]</sup></a>, is painted in the first
moment of reaching the unfortunate one. He places
his left hand under her body, and, overcome by the
horror of the sight, lets fall his sceptre from his right
hand as he gazes for a moment in transfixed agony
from his daughter’s situation. The position of the arms
is exactly that of the same figure on the sarcophagi
reliefs<a id='r278' /><a href='#f278' class='c020'><sup>[278]</sup></a>, and no doubt would be traceable through the
five intervening centuries if the monuments were at
hand. Our vase would appear to represent here a tradition
that was always closely followed in representing
Kreon in an upright position.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>Merope, the mother, who is mentioned in Corinthian
legends only as the wife of Sisyphos<a id='r279' /><a href='#f279' class='c020'><sup>[279]</sup></a> and of Polybos<a id='r280' /><a href='#f280' class='c020'><sup>[280]</sup></a>,
does not appear at all in Euripides. The painter’s
principle was to name all the chief figures on the vase,
and it is not necessary to point out here another source
than the <cite>Medeia</cite> of Euripides. A name thus known as
belonging to Corinthian royal families would be a natural
invention for the wife of Kreon if there was no legend
to provide further information about her. I hold this
painting, however, as adequate evidence that there was
a <em>third</em> Merope known in Corinth<a id='r281' /><a href='#f281' class='c020'><sup>[281]</sup></a>. That the mother
as well as the father should be represented here is
further witness of the spirit which the poet breathed
into his work. Medeia’s fixed determination to ruin
all her enemies at one blow and to root out the whole
royal house in a day (vs. 373 f.) is expressed in the extended
scene here given, in a manner well calculated
to inspire the beholder with much that lies between the
lines in Euripides. There is absolutely no reason for
claiming this scene as an extension of that given in the
poet, and therefore based upon a post-Euripidean tragedy.
One who denies the vase painter the right to introduce
figures foreign to the poet fails utterly in comprehending
the spirit of the fourth and third century vase painting.
The artists followed the number of characters in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>poetical version no more slavishly than they did the
disposition and movement of the same. Starting with
what the poet gave them and holding this in mind as
a guide and inspiration in certain details, the painters
proceeded to create, as <em>independent</em> artists, a similar scene,
transfused, however, with their own alterations. It is to
be expected that in the over-filled vase paintings of
Apulia and Campania one will find figures that show
a wide liberty on the part of the painters, and that
illustrate well how much the severe methods of the
Athenian vase painters had been altered in Magna
Graecia.</p>

<p class='c009'>Another instance of this same independence of the
painter is seen in the introduction of Hippotes, to whom
there is not the slightest reference in Euripides. In
vs. 1168–1203, where Kreusa’s fate is described, no one
is referred to as present except the female attendants,
who were possessed with terror and lent no aid to their
mistress. Kreon unexpectedly entered, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ξυμφορᾶς ἀγνωσίᾳ</span>,
and soon succumbed, a victim together with his
daughter. Why does Hippotes appear on the vase as
the one who is trying to liberate Kreusa? With Vogel<a id='r282' /><a href='#f282' class='c020'><sup>[282]</sup></a>
again the answer <i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">liegt auf der Hand: weil Euripides
nicht die Quelle der Darstellung ist</span></i>. Because the painter
enlarged the scene of the poet, and was more tragic and
more dramatic than Euripides, a later or at least another
version of the myth is claimed as his authority. This
appears to me altogether <em>improbable</em> and <em>unnecessary</em>.
It is <em>improbable</em> because, as we have abundant reason
to believe, Euripides’ version of the myth was, both in
Greek and Roman times, the most popular<a id='r283' /><a href='#f283' class='c020'><sup>[283]</sup></a>. Other
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span><cite>Medeias</cite> are mere names. Furthermore our vase cannot
be dated later than the second half of the fourth century
<span class='fss'>B.C.</span>, i. e. not much more than a century after the first
appearance of the <cite>Medeia</cite> in 431 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span> This is an
important fact which seems to have been mostly overlooked.
Euripides, it must be remembered, ruled the
fourth century <span class='fss'>B.C.</span> as the prophet of the time, and was
hailed by the Greeks of the colonies and the motherland
with universal admiration. It is safe to say that no
Greek poet was more upon the lips of the people or
more in their hearts. Tardy as was the recognition
of his genius during his lifetime, the extent of his
posthumous fame was unparalleled and his name rang
through Alexandrian and Hellenistic times as that of
one of the immortals. Are we to suppose then that
a vase painter of Magna Graecia, who might have lived
with those who had seen Euripides, was, in dealing with
the Medeia myth, under the influence of some poet of
a day? Was an artist who lived in this proximity to
Euripides’ own time likely to follow the guidance of any
other than the great master who created the Medeia
character and started her down the centuries in that
unexampled rage and fury? We dare, moreover, go
further and claim with Robert that <i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">die Vasen stehen der
Aufführungszeit der Medeia so nahe, dass sie den Werth
directer Zeugnisse beanspruchen dürfen</span></i><a id='r284' /><a href='#f284' class='c020'><sup>[284]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c009'>This explanation is <em>unnecessary</em>, for, as we have already
pointed out, the vase painters gave less heed to the
subject-matter and the details of the traditional types
than to the general effect and dramatic arrangement.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>It was possible to double the dramatic effect here through
the introduction of the bride’s brother, and the painter
did not hesitate to place him on the vase, although the
poet did not refer to him. The onward rush of this
finely drawn figure, with his chlamys fluttering in the
wind, has altogether a dramatic air and brings one to
feel that the theatrical element, so much in the background
in the fifth century <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>, had taken possession
of the fourth century work<a id='r285' /><a href='#f285' class='c020'><sup>[285]</sup></a>. It is surprising to find
with what persistency certain scholars refuse such
additions as incompatible with the dependence of the
work on a given literary source. If the artist has done
more than <em>illustrate</em>, all relationship between him and
the poet is denied. But let us turn to a famous work
where illustration pure and simple is meant, and we shall
discover that if one follows even there this mode of
criticism, the poet and the drawing which is meant to
illustrate him will have to be divorced. I refer to
Botticelli’s drawings for Dante’s <cite><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Divina Commedia</span></cite><a id='r286' /><a href='#f286' class='c020'><sup>[286]</sup></a>.
Each drawing is intended to bring out the events of the
<i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">canto</span></i> to which it is devoted, and so one expects only
the incidents of one <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">canto</span></i> to appear in one drawing.
The illustration for the <cite>Inferno</cite>, <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">canto</span></i> ii, represents
Beatrice swinging upward in the air, to whom Virgil
is pointing and calling Dante’s attention. This is all
a pure invention of the artist as Beatrice is simply
mentioned in the text, and not at all thought of as
present or appearing to the two pilgrims. Had Botticelli
then some other story in mind, and was there another
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>version of Dante than that which we have? Certainly
not. The artist, although in this place engaged as
a mere illustrator, read his own notions into Dante
and put them into his drawing. Again, even on the
same plate, the entrance to the <cite>Inferno</cite> is shown with
the words <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">per me</span></i> over the door. This scene belongs
to <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">canto</span></i> iii, where in fact Botticelli again introduces it.
If, therefore, the third <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">canto</span></i> and the drawing that
belongs to it had never reached us but we did possess
<i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">canto</span></i> ii and its illustration, how would the critics who
read the Greek vases as we have indicated, dispose of
Botticelli and his faithfulness to Dante? They would
all declare that the famous painter must have had
another text which he followed. And so one may go
on multiplying instances in this one work to show that
an artist, even when he set out to follow the poet, was
not able to do so<a id='r287' /><a href='#f287' class='c020'><sup>[287]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c009'>There are also among the Pompeian wall paintings<a id='r288' /><a href='#f288' class='c020'><sup>[288]</sup></a>
some that are mere illustrations and are in the spirit
of this sort of work, and yet they show various peculiar
changes and additions contrary to the epigrams
on which they are based. One is to remember therefore
that in the vase paintings, where a more independent
form of art is found than in illustrations, a liberty
in adding or omitting figures, that may often disturb
the form of the myth, is to be allowed. To select one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>example from many: Euphronios<a id='r289' /><a href='#f289' class='c020'><sup>[289]</sup></a> on the Eurystheus
kylix represents Sthenelos and his wife as present when
Herakles brings the boar and is about to drop it into the
cistern where Eurystheus has taken refuge. That the
latter was king and had imposed the labours on Herakles,
was proof enough that Sthenelos was already dead.
How then did Euphronios dare to place him on the
vase? Evidently because he took little heed of the
exactitude for which modern scholars would call him
and others of his trade to account.</p>

<p class='c009'>The old nurse who observed the first signs of her
mistress’ precarious condition—<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">καὶ τις γεραιὰ προσπόλων&nbsp;... ἀνωλόλυξε</span> (vs. 1171–73)—or one of the numerous
attendants present (v. 1176) may be recognized in the
figure to the right from Hippotes. Perhaps this is more
correctly the one who broke away to convey the sad
news to Jason—<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἑ δὲ πρὸς τὸν ἀρτίως πόσιν, | φράσουσα
νύμφης συμφοράς</span> (vs. 1178 f.). This person with the
matronly air always occurs on the sarcophagi, but in
the scene where the two boys are handing over the gifts
to Kreusa<a id='r290' /><a href='#f290' class='c020'><sup>[290]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c009'>The position of the pedagogue on the opposite side
is not so incongruous as many have thought. There is
really no reason for considering him a sort of connecting
link between the middle and lower sections, as Robert
has done<a id='r291' /><a href='#f291' class='c020'><sup>[291]</sup></a>. Let us follow the pedagogue and the boys
through the play. At vs. 46 f. of the prologue the
nurse reports the latter as returning from their sport—<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐκ

<p class='c022'>At v. 105 the three disappear and nothing more is heard

<p class='c022'>Hereupon the boys appear in the orchestra, <em>unaccompanied</em>
by their pedagogue, and remain with Medeia and
Jason till vs. 969 ff., where their mother hands them the
gifts and bids them go, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὁς τάχιστα</span> (v. 974), to Kreusa
and place the same in her hands. They then depart
with their father and deliver the presents in the manner
afterwards described by the messenger (vs. 1136–1155),
and in company with Jason leave Kreusa’s apartments.
Just outside somewhere the pedagogue joins them and
appears with the children in the orchestra to inform
Medeia that her sons have been pardoned (vs. 1002 ff.).
Immediately thereafter she orders the pedagogue to
go inside,</p>

<p class='c022'>As he re-enters the palace the terrible news reaches
him, through, one of the female attendants, that Kreusa
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>is possessed with some strange malady. It is at this
juncture, dramatic in the extreme, that, as it seems
to me, the vase painter thought of the pedagogue. The
latter has forgotten Medeia’s command to arrange the
boys’ program for the day and is determined to go
to the apartments whence comes the great alarm. The
attendant, however, endeavours to dissuade him, and the
artist has even represented her in the attempt to deter
the sturdy old pedagogue from carrying out his resolution.
While all this is happening within the palace, Medeia
gives expression to the great battle that is going on in
her bosom. The speech is one of the finest in Euripides.
Shall she now go ahead and kill her children, or is the
courage lacking? She finally bids them enter the house
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">χωρεῖτε, παῖδες, ἐς δόμους</span> (vs. 1053 and 1076), and soon
follows them. The death-cries of vs. 1271 ff. are heard
not long afterwards. We have therefore no reason to
infer from anything in Euripides that the pedagogue
ever met the boys again. The fact that he is so often
represented in the death-scene<a id='r292' /><a href='#f292' class='c020'><sup>[292]</sup></a> is simply due to the
fancy of the artists. It is natural to think of him in
company with the boys. The vase painter has in the
present instance shown us the whereabouts of the
pedagogue when the poet had passed him by.</p>

<p class='c009'>The lower section, which represents the events directly
succeeding those in the one just considered, completes
the dread vengeance work of Medeia. The artist had
an opportunity here to follow largely his own notions in
disposing of the details, for in the last moments when
horror followed close upon horror, and the royal house
of Corinth was shaking to its foundations, Euripides
hurries us on with great rapidity and omits many of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>particulars. Medeia moves with resistless fury through
the last part of the bloody drama, till she at last disappears
upon her chariot. What was the vase painter
to do with all this? It is plain that he felt himself
compelled to combine, for greater effect, different
moments. Medeia enters the palace after the triumphant
address in vs. 1236–1250, and a moment later the cries
of the boys are heard within. Jason, aroused by the
ruin wrought upon Kreusa, suddenly appears and asks
where Medeia is, and remarks that he must save his sons
from the fury of the populace (vs. 1293–1305). He
at once learns the whole truth, and orders that the palace
doors be thrown open that he may behold the scene
of murder. Medeia appears then on her chariot, rolled
out upon the ekkyklema. She stands thus during the
final dialogue with Jason (vs. 1317–1404) till she disappears
by the aid of the <i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Flugmaschine</span></i><a id='r293' /><a href='#f293' class='c020'><sup>[293]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c009'>From these elements the vase painter selected the
murder scene, which, not being described by Euripides,
could be represented in any manner that struck his
fancy. He made this the centre about which all else
was grouped; all eyes are turned upon Medeia and the
altar. In this disposition of the matter other details
had to be sacrificed. The chariot, which could not be
wanting, had to have a charioteer, and as Medeia was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>not ready to mount it herself, the personification of the
Medeia-spirit is the natural figure that the artist would
select. Jason, again, to omit whom would have been
unpardonable, had to be painted in the act of rescuing
or attempting the rescue of his sons. So we see that
the three moments discernible in the poet, (<em>a</em>) the
murder, (<em>b</em>) Jason’s appearance to save the boys, (<em>c</em>) the
chariot and the escape of Medeia, are all worked
together by the artist into a strong complex. One
feels no incongruity in the picture, and is forced to
agree to a large amount of success that the artist has
enjoyed here. Since the pedagogue appears in the
scene above, the artist uses one of the ever convenient
doryphoroi as a companion to the boys or rather as
rescuer of one of them<a id='r294' /><a href='#f294' class='c020'><sup>[294]</sup></a>. It is immaterial whether the
painter intended to represent the one boy as actually
out of danger or not. A great many useless words
have been spent in trying to show that the vase painter
has here followed a tradition referred to by Diodorus
Siculus<a id='r295' /><a href='#f295' class='c020'><sup>[295]</sup></a>, who relates that one child escaped—<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πλὴν γὰρ
ἑνὸς τοῦ διαφυγόντος τοὺς ἄλλους υἱοὺς ἀποσφάξαι</span>. This
is not only highly improbable<a id='r296' /><a href='#f296' class='c020'><sup>[296]</sup></a>, but, more than that,
speaks for a superficial reading of Diodorus on the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>part of those who use this quotation. It appears that
nothing more of the chapter had been read than it was
necessary to quote. In the first place, what can <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τοὺς
ἄλλους</span> above refer to if not to <em>more than one</em>, and
therefore to at least <em>two</em>? But where upon our vase or
upon any other monument does Medeia appear with <em>three</em>
children<a id='r297' /><a href='#f297' class='c020'><sup>[297]</sup></a>? It would seem, therefore, that, because the vase
painter drew the scene as he did, this very inapt quotation
is brought out to bolster up an unnecessary theory.</p>

<p class='c009'>Is it necessary to conclude with numerous scholars
that Oistros upon the chariot represents one of Pollux’s
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἔκσκευα πρόσωπα</span> (iv. 141)? Does our painting necessarily
go back to some tragedy in which the personification,
Oistros, appears before the audience as Medeia’s
charioteer? It has already been pointed out that the
moment which the vase painter chose to represent never
was visible in the theatre of Euripides. What happened
before the palace doors were unbarred, in v. 1314, could
be painted in a hundred different ways, and still be
inspired by the poet from v. 1271 to v. 1316. It is
true that Euripides does not mention <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Οἶστρος</span>, much less
as Medeia’s charioteer. What need had he to introduce
any personification of her rage and fury to guide the
chariot, when, at the first glimpse of it in v. 1317, Medeia
manages it herself? Any one who thoroughly works
himself into the situation that the painter has shown
upon the vase cannot help seeing that Medeia’s double,
her burning and infuriated barbarian wildness, the spirit
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>shown in vs. 1236–1250, was a natural and easy subject
for embodiment under the name <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Οἶστρος</span>. This personification
is not met with in Euripides, and has naturally
caused much stumbling. It should, however, be compared
with <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Λύσσα</span>, with which it has much in common.
Orestes says to Pylades, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μὴ θεαί</span> (i. e. the Furies) <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μ’ οἴστρω
κατασχῶς’</span><a id='r298' /><a href='#f298' class='c020'><sup>[298]</sup></a>, and two verses further on, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">εὐλαβοῦ Λύσσης
μετασχεῖν τῆς ἐμῆς</span>. Thus the use of the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">οἶστρος</span> caused
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Λύσσα</span>. The step to the personification of a figure
Oistros would easily follow from some such development
as this, and I hold both words to cover the <em>cause</em> and
<em>effect</em> in the case mentioned.</p>

<p class='c009'>As Lyssa was a favourite figure with Euripides, we
may examine still another place where the rôle that she
plays is much the same as that which Oistros takes in
the painting.</p>

<p class='c009'>In <cite><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Her. Fur.</span></cite> vs. 880 ff., the chorus describes Lyssa as
<em>travelling upon a chariot</em><a id='r299' /><a href='#f299' class='c020'><sup>[299]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c022'><span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>Here at least one has adequate evidence that the vase

<p class='c009'>The shade of Aetes<a id='r303' /><a href='#f303' class='c020'><sup>[303]</sup></a>, a pure invention of the artist,
has been held to refer to a post-Euripidean tragedy.
One finds such pedantic ingenuity used in explaining
this figure that the would-be-learnedness borders upon
the ridiculous. It is affirmed, for example, that somewhere
it <em>must have been stated for the vase painter
that Aetes had died since Medeia left him</em><a id='r304' /><a href='#f304' class='c020'><sup>[304]</sup></a>. How
far, pray, did vase painters concern themselves about
such points of chronology or sequence of events? We
have already pointed out in regard to these artists that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>they introduced and omitted characters just as they
chose; and especially is this true in regard to such side-figures
as Aetes is here. Then again, why is any literary
source necessary to prove the old man’s death? It was
but the natural course of events that the painter followed
when he concluded that Aetes was among the
shades. It is absurd to require some proof that the
unlucky king had, within the long period of Medeia’s
absence, passed into the world of spirits. It seems to
me that there are two views that can adequately
explain this addition to the picture, and with either
one in mind the vase painter would have needed no
post-Euripidean work or painting but simply the <cite>Medeia</cite>
tragedy to inspire him.</p>

but a small part of the whole suggestion, and it is well
to follow this note which recurs in many places, and is,
to my mind, a very important part of the Euripidean
conception of Medeia. I give herewith the various places

<p class='c022'><span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>These repeated allusions to her father and her former
home seem to me to express in a strong manner what
the painter chose to develop into the ghost-figure.
Aetes appears here to behold the retribution that is
overtaking Jason; and his participation in the fearful
tragedy emphasizes the secret power in Medeia, her
sorcery, and her chariot. The artist read between the
lines and discovered the spirit of the poet, and this he
has successfully reproduced. A similar instance was
noted in the liberty assumed by Botticelli in including
Beatrice in the second plate to the <cite>Inferno</cite><a id='r306' /><a href='#f306' class='c020'><sup>[306]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the second place the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">εἴδωλον</span> emphasizes the
barbaric element in the Medeia-Jason history, and impresses
the beholder with the workings of barbarism
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">versus</span></i> Hellenism. This chord is, moreover, continuously
struck by Euripides<a id='r307' /><a href='#f307' class='c020'><sup>[307]</sup></a>. The poet endeavours from first to
last to keep up the keenest distinction between Greece
and Kolchis, between Jason’s family and that of
Aetes.</p>

<p class='c009'>There was, moreover, an opportunity, in introducing
this oriental king, to add features strikingly characteristic
of the Apulian vase paintings<a id='r308' /><a href='#f308' class='c020'><sup>[308]</sup></a>. The elegance and
display of costume peculiar to the Persian and Asia
Minor kings were attractive for an artist, and the introduction
of Aetes’ shade was a happy invention that
went far towards making the deeper meaning of the
poet plain.</p>

<p class='c009'>The deities, who, as spectators, are an important part
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>of the paintings on so many Lower Italy vases, are
arranged in the upper section. They need not have
any particular connexion with the incidents before
them. The Olympian sympathy with earthly affairs
was a favourite theme with the artists of the time, and
a satisfactory number of participating divinities is usually
added where important events occur. Herakles and
Athena seem to be but indifferently interested in what
is happening below them, although the former was
intimately associated with the Argonautic expedition<a id='r309' /><a href='#f309' class='c020'><sup>[309]</sup></a>,
and the latter was the promoter of the enterprise<a id='r310' /><a href='#f310' class='c020'><sup>[310]</sup></a>. The
Dioskouroi, who likewise took a large part in the adventures
of the voyage, are fitly represented here<a id='r311' /><a href='#f311' class='c020'><sup>[311]</sup></a>.
They are, however, giving no heed to the tragedy. It
is enough if the painter has recalled for us the famous
voyage and shown us the prelude, as it were, to the
drama played in the two lower sections. The panorama
of Jason and Medeia’s life together passes before us in
distinct scenes. By painting the participants in the
expedition and also the shade of Aetes the artist has
heightened the effect of the double tragedy which the
poet made famous.</p>

<p class='c009'>Such is the painting on this celebrated amphora, which
I do not hesitate to call Euripidean.</p>

<p class='c009'>Another monument which also shows Kreusa’s death
is a vase from Pomarico, now in Naples<a id='r312' /><a href='#f312' class='c020'><sup>[312]</sup></a>.</p>

<p>Fig. 24.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Kreusa has fallen from the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">θρόνος</span> that occupies the
middle of the scene, and in a half-sitting posture upon
the floor endeavours to remove the head-dress. Before
her is the open box in which the presents were brought.
A mirror hangs on the wall. She is dressed in the
Ionic chiton with mantle; has earrings and one bracelet.
She stares at Kreon, who hurries toward her with outstretched
right hand. He has the sceptre in the left
hand, is bearded, bald, and wears a chiton which has
slipped down to his waist. To the left a female figure
rushes away <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en face</span></i>, and, watching Kreusa, makes the
gestures of one terror-stricken. She is dressed like the
latter except the earrings and necklace. Jahn called
her a companion of Kreusa, considering that if she were
Merope of the Munich vase she would be approaching
her daughter and not leaving her. I prefer to see in
this figure one of the attendants who in vs. 1177 ff. spread
the news. It is true that the appearance of the figure
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>is that of a more important personage than a servant.
The latter are not usually represented wearing jewellery
and fine costumes, and yet the attendant on the Munich
vase, who is endeavouring to divert the pedagogue, is
quite as richly dressed. In the present instance, however,
the drawing is very careless and the workmanship
is of an inferior sort. I believe, therefore, that the artist
either did not know the fitness of things, or else took
no pains to indicate that this figure was a servant or
attendant. When he had once drawn such a miserable
king as Kreon is, hobbling along in a ridiculous
manner, he might well have slipped into the other
extreme of painting a nurse in a lady’s garb. The
scene is based upon the messenger’s speech, vs. 1176 ff.</p>

<p class='c009'>The pedagogue on the right, who is hurrying away
the two boys wrapped in cloaks, is a reminiscence of
vs. 1157 ff. where the father, Jason, goes away with them.</p>

a free handling of Medeia’s escape, is still an important

is Euripidean.</p>

<p class='c009'>Medeia in rapid flight upon her dragon-chariot holds
the reins in her left hand and the corner of her mantle in
the right. Her dress is the customary one for charioteers.
On the ground by the wheels one boy lies dead; the
other is said to be visible on the original, inside of the
chariot as on the sarcophagi. The sword is also on
the ground. She is pursued by three youths, one on
horseback, Jason (?), and two on foot. They all carry
spears, and each has a chlamys. The middle one also
wears a pilos and has a shield. In front of the chariot
is Lyssa (?) with a sword in the right hand, and staff or
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κέντρον</span> (?) in the left. She has an Artemis costume
with a mantle. Galloping ahead to lead the way is
Selene, seated as usual on her horse.</p>

Roman literature and art<a id='r315' /><a href='#f315' class='c020'><sup>[315]</sup></a>. We have here to do with
a relief cup, which illustrates Euripides’ version of the
combat. It possesses, like the other ‘Megarian Bowls’
discussed in the present work, a value so unique for the
study of our poet that it may stand beside any vase
painting in assisting us in the study of the drama’s
influence upon art.</p>

upon the Antiope myth. (1) The two sons of Antiope have the unfortunate
Dirke all but fastened to the bull, which is being held only
with the utmost exertion. (2) The catastrophe ensues. The wild
animal is dragging his victim over the ground. It need not be said that
the most celebrated representation of (1) is the <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">toro farnese</span></i>. For (2), cf.
a wall painting, pub. <cite><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Arch. Ztg.</span></cite> 1878, pl. 9, <em>a</em> and <em>b</em>. The myth was
wonderfully popular and appears on coins, gems, reliefs, &amp;c., all of

<p class='c009'><a href='#r93'>93</a>. The question as to where and how the Etruscans came to have
so wide a knowledge of Greek poetry will long remain a perplexing one.
One thing seems clear, viz., that the Romans did not serve as any connecting
link between Greece and Etruria. Greek art as well as Greek
letters reached this people direct. It hardly seems probable that translations
of the Greek poets were so extensively made by this practical people,
that the artists could in this manner have had access to so much that is
Euripidean. There is, moreover, a great deal in some of the reliefs that
bespeaks a familiarity with the scenes as actually given in the theatre.
This leads me to think that the wandering troops of actors had penetrated
Etruria also, and introduced the plays of which the Etruscans made so
much in their art.</p>

important monument into connexion with the drama, I cannot think of a
later date for the vase than 440 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>, which to be sure renders its
relation to Sophokles impossible. If, however, Professor Robert be
correct, it shows that there is at least one vase painting of the fifth

<div class='footnote' id='f147'>
<p class='c009'><a href='#r147'>147</a>. Opinions vary on this point. Three different views are held.
(1) The temple of Athena remains the scene throughout the rest of the
play; the Areiopagos (v. 685) becomes then merely a part of the stage
decorations given by the periaktoi. (2) Between v. 235 and v. 685 the
scene was changed from the Acropolis to the Areiopagos. (3) There is no
scene from v. 235 other than the Areiopagos. The latter seems to
me absolutely untenable. Repeated allusion is made to the temple and
to Orestes clinging to the old image in the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">δῶμα</span> (v. 242 ff.). Regarding
the first and second, it makes little difference whether the scene was in
fact shifted or whether it was represented on the wings. The practical
working was the same in either case.</p>

<p class='c009'><a href='#r148'>148</a>. The present whereabouts of the vase is not known. Pub. Baumeister,

He disposes of it in a line or two, and, with the usual accuracy which
characterizes philologists when dealing with matters of archaeology, says
the vase is ‘probably nearly contemporaneous’ with the <cite><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Eumenides</span></cite>
(p. 584). The composition is remarkably like the Assteas painting,
<cite><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Wiener Vorlegeblätter</span></cite>, ser. i. pl. 7. The figures of Apollo and Kadmos,
as well as the two Athenas, have much in common. There is the same
roundness and plumpness in the figures. Furthermore, Assteas was partial
to bust figures and never lost an opportunity to introduce them. The
border on the veil of the female bust of our vase is Campanian, as are
also certain other details. All this brings me to the opinion that Assteas,
who was very likely from Paestum and may have been in touch with
Campanian styles as well, was the painter of our vase. It is at least
from the school of Assteas. A painting by Python (<cite>J. H. S.</cite> 1890, pl. 6),
one of the set of Assteas, exhibits the same treatment of hair and
decoration that is found on the painting, fig. 9.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f180'>
<p class='c009'><a href='#r180'>180</a>. ‘Megarian Bowls’ is a name applied to a class of small cups decorated
with a band of relief. The ware is red or black, and appears both in glazed
and unglazed form. The largest number of the vases has been found
in Megara, hence the name ‘Megarian.’ As many have been discovered
also in Boeotia and other places, the present terminology is somewhat
misleading. Examples of this ware are to be found in every large
museum in Europe. The British Museum possesses no less than nine
such cups, and fragments from fourteen others (vid. cat. iv. pp. 251–256).
The reliefs illustrate mostly scenes from the Theban and Trojan Cycles.
Whether the terra cotta presented a cheap way of reproducing silver and
gold cups, which were highly prized, and served therefore the place
of our casts, or whether the bowls were made from special moulds and
are to be considered independent works of art, is quite uncertain. The
fact that there are in existence three copies of the same work, each
agreeing in every detail with the others, would seem to point to the former
supposition. Robert, who has handled this set of monuments most
thoroughly, distinguishes two classes: (1) the whole vase is cast from
one mould; (2) the reliefs having been made separately are stamped on
the ready bowl. Vid. especially Robert’s <cite><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Homerische Becher</span></cite> for the

this group as again Phaidra and an attendant. I cannot, however,
rid myself of the feeling that the figure leaning on the <em>kline</em> is not
a servant, but is more in rank with Phaidra. Her rôle is more than that
of the other attendants. This is shown by her attitude and dress. Her
appearance is exactly that required for Phaidra after she had ordered her
attendants to lift her up, remove her veil, and allow her hair to drop

<p class='c009'><a href='#r197'>197</a>. The remarkable feature in these reliefs that shows non-Euripidean
influence is the letter which the old nurse hands to Hippolytos. This
points to another handling of the myth, where the former confined
herself to a written statement rather than a word of mouth proposal.
Strikingly in harmony with Euripides, however, is the position of the
trophos. She grasps Hippolytos’ elbow—<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ναὶ πρός δε τῆσδε δεξιᾶς εὐωλένου</span>
(v. 605). Cf. also the Pompeian wall painting, <cite><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Mus. Borbonico</span></cite>, 8, pl. 52.

Marathonschlacht</span></cite>, p. 37; Robert calls attention to the fact that this is an
essentially Athenian assembly. Poseidon, Athena, and Pan were inseparably
associated with the Acropolis, the latter, of course, after the
battle of Marathon. The Naples vase represents a battle between Greeks
and barbarians, and according to Robert’s theory is dependent upon
Polygnotos’ painting in the Stoa Poikile. As participants and spectators
the gods occur in the upper section. Athena, indeed, whirls into line on
her chariot. If this ingenious theory has hit the gist of the matter
regarding the Naples painting, then we may also claim the group of gods
on the Hippolytos vase as peculiarly Athenian. And such would be very
appropriate for a picture that represented an Attic tragedy, whose hero
had a cult under the shadow of the Acropolis.</p>

<p class='c009'><a href='#r263'>263</a>. My remark applies only to the extant monuments, for one finds that
Pausanias saw the marriage of Jason and Medeia represented on
the Kypselos Chest (5. 18. 3). This is in keeping with the Corinthian
origin of the Chest. It is hardly to be expected that such domestic
events in Medeia’s career would have found their place in any work of
art that was not made in Corinth, or at least in a place essentially
influenced by Corinthian legend.</p>

that they all date from about the second century <span class='fss'>A.D.</span>, and could thus be
based on various Roman plays, the arrangement of the events on the
reliefs bears a remarkable similarity to the scenes in Euripides. The
reliefs on the long sides are taken up with exactly the scenes of the Greek
poet. Those on the ends are but indifferently worked out, and often do
not represent any events in the Medeia-Jason adventures.</p>

still in Euripides suggestions of the name if one were seeking such for
the figure. In v. 404, Medeia declares she ‘will not be a laughing-stock
to the race of <em>Sisyphos</em> and Jason’s new alliances’; and in v. 1381, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">γη δε τηδε

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you

</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;

must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the

Gutenberg&#8482; License.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or

Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
